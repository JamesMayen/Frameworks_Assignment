Study Design: This was a follow-up study. Participants who met the entry criteria were administered with escitalopram (5–10 mg/day) as an initial treatment. Self-evaluation and observer valuations were arranged at the end of weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12, with blood samples collected at baseline and during weeks 2 and 12. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was then carried out by incorporating three cytokines selected by the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model. Internal validation was estimated using the bootstrap method with 1,000 repetitions. Results: A total of 85 patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), including 62 responders and 23 non-responders, were analyzed. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and lipocalin-2 were selected by the LASSO regression model. The area under the curve (AUC) from the logistic model was 0.811 and was confirmed as 0.7887 following bootstrapping validation.

We identified 56 unique binding clones that exhibited high affinity and specificity to the spike protein. Of those, 10 showed an ability to block both the spike protein receptor binding domain from the Wuhan variant and the N501Y mutant from interacting with recombinant ACE2 receptor in vitro. In addition, 3 antibody clones retained in vitro blocking activity when the E484K spike protein mutant was used. The inhibitory property of the VNAR antibodies was further confirmed for all 10 antibody clones using ACE2 expressing cells with spike protein from the Wuhan variant. The viral neutralizing potential of the VNAR clones was also confirmed for the 10 antibodies tested using live Wuhan variant virus in in vitro cell infectivity assays.

We developed a point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) first approach to patients requiring echocardiography and describe our workflow and findings. METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective analysis of all POCUS studies performed on critically ill patients with COVID-19. Sonography was performed by intensivists, uploaded and archived, and rapidly reviewed by echocardiographers. We evaluated each study based on the number of views obtained. Additionally, we provide a description of the workflow during the COVID-19 surge at a tertiary care hospital in New York City. RESULTS: Fifty patients had POCUS studies performed by intensivists and reviewed by echocardiographers obviating the need for sonographer-performed studies. Of the 48 cardiac POCUS studies, 17% of patients had 4 of 4 standard views available while 53% had 3 of 4 standard views. The parasternal long-axis view was obtained on 81%, subxiphoid view on 79%, apical 4-chamber view on 71%, and parasternal short-axis view on 63% of patients.

Because of the rapid deterioration in some patients, markers that could predict poor clinical outcomes are urgently required. This study was to evaluate the predictive values of cardiac injury parameters, including cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels, on mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: COVID-19 patients in Zhongfaxincheng branch of Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China) from February 8–28, 2020, were enrolled in this study. We followed up the patients for 30 days after admission. RESULTS: A total of 134 patients were included in the study. Multivariate Cox regression showed that 1) patients with elevated cTnI levels had a higher risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 7.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.56–21.00) than patients with normal cTnI levels; 2) patients with elevated NT-proBNP levels had a higher risk of death (HR 27.88, 95% CI 3.55–218.78) than patients with normal NT-proBNP levels; 3) patients with both elevated cTnI and NT-proBNP levels had a significantly higher risk of death (HR 53.87, 95% CI 6.31–459.91, P < 0.001) compared to patients without elevated cTnI or NT-proBNP levels; 4) the progressions of cTnI and NT-proBNP levels were also correlated with death (HR 12.70, 95% CI 3.94–40.88, P < 0.001 and HR 51.09, 95% CI 5.82–448.26, P < 0.001).

METHODS This is a cluster-randomized trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02631161). 88 patients (50-70 years) with 175 sNCCLs were randomized to receive GH or RC. Restorations were placed without mechanical cavity preparation and followed for a mean 36 (min/max: 31/55) months (variable follow-up due to COVID-19 lockdown). Restoration quality was re-evaluated at 1-, 18- and 36-months using FDI-criteria. Survival was assessed using multi-level Cox-regression analysis. Costs were estimated from a payer's perspective in Germany. Initial costs were determined based on micro-costing using time recordings and hourly costs, and follow-up costs based on statutory insurance fee-item-catalogues. RESULTS 88 patients (175 restorations) were treated; 43 received GH (83 restorations), 45 RC (92 restorations). 17 GH and 19 RC showed total retention loss, 5 GH were partially lost (p = 0.396/Cox). FDI ratings were not sufficiently different for any domain except surface luster, where RC showed higher score (p < 0.001). Costs were initially lower for GH (32.57; SD 16.36 €) than RC (44.25; SD 21.40), while re-treatment costs were similar (GH: 9.15; SD 15.70 €; RC: 7.35; SD 14.51 €), resulting in significantly lower costs for GH (GH: 41.72; SD 25.08 €) than RC (51.6; 26.17 €) (p < 0.001/GLM). CONCLUSIONS While survival was not significantly different, GH was significantly less costly both initially and long-term than RC for restoring non-carious cervical lesions. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Within this trial, survival was not significantly different between GH and RC to restore sclerotic NCCLs. As GH was significantly less costly both initially and long-term than RC, using RC was only cost-effective for payers willing to invest high additional expenses per minimal survival gains.",2021-05-09,"Schwendicke, Falk; Müller, Anne; Seifert, Tilmann; Jeggle-Engbert, Linda-Maria; Paris, Sebastian; Göstemeyer, Gerd",Journal of dentistry,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdent.2021.103689; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33979577/,234485613.0

In this study, 829 serum specimens were collected from 643 patients initially reported to be infected with SARS-CoV. The sera were tested for the N protein of SARS-CoV by using an antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on monoclonal antibodies against the N protein of SARS-CoV and compared to 197 control serum samples from healthy donors and non-SARS febrile patients. The results of the N protein detection analysis were directly related to the serological analysis data. From 27 SARS patients who tested positive with the neutralization test, 100% of the 24 sera collected from 1 to 10 days after the onset of symptoms were positive for the N protein. N protein was not detected beyond day 11 in this group. The positive rates of N protein for sera collected at 1 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, and 16 to 20 days after the onset of symptoms for 414 samples from 298 serologically confirmed patients were 92.9, 69.8, 36.4, and 21.1%, respectively. For 294 sera from 248 serological test-negative patients, the rates were 25.6, 16.7, 9.3, and 0%, respectively. The N protein was not detected in 66 patients with cases of what was initially suspected to be SARS but serologically proven to be negative for SARS and in 197 serum samples from healthy donors and non-SARS febrile patients. The specificity of the assay was 100%. Furthermore, of 16 sera collected from four patients during the SARS recurrence in Guangzhou, 5 sera collected from 7 to 9 days after the onset of symptoms were positive for the N protein. N protein detection exhibited a high positive rate, 96 to 100%, between day 3 and day 5 after the onset of symptoms for 27 neutralization test-positive SARS patients and 298 serologically confirmed patients. The N protein detection rate continually decreased beginning with day 10, and N protein was not detected beyond day 19 after the onset of symptoms.

METHODS The derivation cohort consisted of patients with AIS enrolled prospectively at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. The validation cohort was prospectively enrolled after the derivation cohort at the University Hospital of Bern and University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, as well as Frankfurt a.M., Germany. The score components were copeptin levels, age, NIH Stroke Scale, and recanalization therapy (CoRisk score). Copeptin levels were measured in plasma drawn within 24 hours of AIS and before any recanalization therapy. The primary outcome of disability and death at 3 months was defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 3 to 6. RESULTS Overall, 1,102 patients were included in the analysis; the derivation cohort contributed 319 patients, and the validation cohort contributed 783. An unfavorable outcome was observed among 436 patients (40%). For the 3-month prediction of disability and death, the CoRisk score was well calibrated in the validation cohort, for which the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.819 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.787-0.849). The calibrated CoRisk score correctly classified 75% of patients (95% CI 72-78). The net reclassification index between the calibrated CoRisk scores with and without copeptin was 46% (95% CI 32-60).

However, access to large-scale phenotypic data has now become a critical barrier that phenomics urgently must overcome. Fortunately, the high-throughput plant phenotyping platform (HT3P), employing advanced sensors and data collection systems, can take full advantage of non-destructive and high-throughput methods to monitor, quantify, and evaluate specific phenotypes for large-scale agricultural experiments, and it can effectively perform phenotypic tasks that traditional phenotyping could not do. In this way, HT3Ps are novel and powerful tools, for which various commercial, customized, and even self-developed ones have been recently introduced in rising numbers. Here, we review these HT3Ps in nearly 7 years from greenhouses and growth chambers to the field, and from ground-based proximal phenotyping to aerial large-scale remote sensing. Platform configurations, novelties, operating modes, current developments, as well the strengths and weaknesses of diverse types of HT3Ps are thoroughly and clearly described. Then, miscellaneous combinations of HT3Ps for comparative validation and comprehensive analysis are systematically present, for the first time. Finally, we consider current phenotypic challenges and provide fresh perspectives on future development trends of HT3Ps.

Using a dynamic panel data model for 108 countries from 1993 to 2018, this study finds that governments’ fiscal balance deteriorates with commodity price volatility, especially for commodity-exporting economies. A one standard deviation increase in commodity price volatility leads to a reduction of approximately 0.04 units in the fiscal balance as a percentage of gross domestic product. Further, we examine the role of real interest rates in influencing the relationship between commodity price volatility and fiscal balance. The empirical results suggest that the negative impact of commodity price volatility on fiscal balance can be mitigated with a lower real interest rate.

SETTING: Laboratory based live SARS-CoV-2 virus study. INTERVENTIONS: Ten different types of sporting equipment were inoculated with 40l droplets containing clinically relevant high and low concentrations of live SARS-CoV-2 virus. Materials were then swabbed at time points relevant to sports (1, 5, 15, 30, 90 minutes). The amount of live SARS-CoV-2 recovered at each time point was enumerated using viral plaque assays, and viral decay and half-life was estimated through fitting linear models to log transformed data from each material. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome measure was quantification of retrievable SARS-CoV-2 virus from each piece of equipment at pre-determined time points. RESULTS: At one minute, SARS-CoV-2 virus was recovered in only seven of the ten types of equipment with the low dose inoculum, one at five minutes and none at 15 minutes. Retrievable virus dropped significantly for all materials tested using the high dose inoculum with mean recovery of virus falling to 0.74% at 1 minute, 0.39% at 15 minutes and 0.003% at 90 minutes. Viral recovery, predicted decay, and half-life varied between materials with porous surfaces limiting virus transmission. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that there is an exponential reduction in SARS-CoV-2 recoverable from a range of sports equipment after a short time period, and virus is less transferrable from materials such as a tennis ball, red cricket ball and cricket glove. Given this rapid loss of viral load and the fact that transmission requires a significant inoculum to be transferred from equipment to the mucous membranes of another individual it seems unlikely that sports equipment is a major cause for transmission of SARS-CoV-2. These findings have important policy implications in the context of the pandemic and may promote other infection control measures in sports to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and urge sports equipment manufacturers to identify surfaces that may or may not be likely to retain transferable virus.",2021-02-08,"Edwards, T.; Kay, G.

Here, we investigate associations between plasma ACE2 and outcome of COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: This analysis used data from a large longitudinal study of 306 COVID-19 positive patients and 78 COVID-19 negative patients (MGH Emergency Department COVID-19 Cohort). Comprehensive clinical data were collected on this cohort, including 28-day outcomes. The samples were run on the Olink® Explore 1536 platform which includes measurement of the ACE2 protein. High admission plasma ACE2 in COVID-19 patients was associated with increased maximal illness severity within 28 days with OR = 1.8, 95%-CI: 1.4–2.3 (P < 0.0001). Plasma ACE2 was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with hypertension compared with patients without hypertension (P = 0.0045). Circulating ACE2 was also significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing heart conditions and kidney disease compared with patients without these pre-existing conditions (P = 0.0363 and P = 0.0303, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that measuring plasma ACE2 is potentially valuable in predicting COVID-19 outcomes.

As of December 2020, 74.7 million people have contracted COVID-19 worldwide and although vaccine distribution has commenced, a recent rise in cases suggest that the pandemic is far from over. METHODS: This piece explores how COVID-19 has explicitly impacted the field of pediatric urology and its patients with a focus on vulnerable subpopulations. RESULTS: Various medical and surgical associations have published guidelines in reaction to the initial onset of the pandemic in early 2020. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: As the number of patients with COVID-19 increases, long-term recovery and future preparedness are imperative and should be cognizant of patient subpopulations that have been subject to disproportionate morbidity and mortality burden. Development of a dedicated response team would aid in achieving preparedness by drafting and implementing plans for resource allocation during scarcity, including logistic and ethical considerations of vaccine distribution.

Reverse-genetics studies of viral genes and mutations have proven highly valuable in advancing basic virus research, leading to the development of therapeutics. We developed a functional and highly versatile full-length SARS-CoV-2 infectious system by cloning the sequence of a COVID-19 associated virus isolate (DK-AHH1) into a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Viruses recovered after RNA-transfection of in vitro transcripts into Vero E6 cells showed growth kinetics and remdesivir susceptibility similar to the DK-AHH1 virus isolate. Insertion of reporter genes, green fluorescent protein, and nanoluciferase into the ORF7 genomic region led to high levels of reporter activity, which facilitated high throughput treatment experiments. We found that putative coronavirus remdesivir resistance-associated substitutions F480L and V570L—and naturally found polymorphisms A97V, P323L, and N491S, all in nsp12—did not decrease SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to remdesivir. A nanoluciferase reporter clone with deletion of spike (S), envelope (E), and membrane (M) proteins exhibited high levels of transient replication, was inhibited by remdesivir, and therefore could function as an efficient non-infectious subgenomic replicon system. The developed SARS-CoV-2 reverse-genetics systems, including recombinants to modify infectious viruses and non-infectious subgenomic replicons with autonomous genomic RNA replication, will permit high-throughput cell culture studies—providing fundamental understanding of basic biology of this coronavirus. We have proven the utility of the systems in rapidly introducing mutations in nsp12 and studying their effect on the efficacy of remdesivir, which is used worldwide for the treatment of COVID-19. Our system provides a platform to effectively test the antiviral activity of drugs and the phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 mutants.",2022-01-18,"Fahnøe, Ulrik; Pham, Long V.; Fernandez-Antunez, Carlota; Costa, Rui; Rivera-Rangel, Lizandro René; Galli, Andrea; Feng, Shan; Mikkelsen, Lotte S.; Gottwein, Judith M.; Scheel, Troels K.

The goal of this study was to determine the incidence, etiology, and outcome of acute respiratory distress syndrome in the pediatric population in the setting of lung protective ventilation. DESIGN A 1-yr, prospective, multicenter, observational study in 12 geographical areas of Spain (serving a population of 3.77 million ≤ 15 yrs of age) covered by 21 pediatric intensive care units. SUBJECTS All consecutive pediatric patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and meeting American-European Consensus Criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Data on ventilatory management, gas exchange, hemodynamics, and organ dysfunction were collected. A total of 146 mechanically ventilated patients fulfilled the acute respiratory distress syndrome definition, representing a incidence of 3.9/100,000 population ≤ 15 yrs of age/yr. Pneumonia and sepsis were the most common causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome. At the time of meeting acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria, mean PaO2/FIO2 was 99 mm Hg ± 41 mm Hg, mean tidal volume was 7.6 mL/kg ± 1.8 mL/kg predicted body weight, mean plateau pressure was 27 cm H2O ± 6 cm H2O, and mean positive end-expiratory pressure was 8.9 cm ± 2.9 cm H2O. Overall pediatric intensive care unit and hospital mortality were 26% (95% confidence interval 19.6-33.7) and 27.4% (95% confidence interval 20.8-35.1), respectively. At 24 hrs, after the assessment of oxygenation under standard ventilatory settings, 118 (80.8%) patients continued to meet acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria (PaO2/FIO2 104 mm Hg ± 36 mm Hg; pediatric intensive care units mortality 30.5%), whereas 28 patients (19.2%) had a PaO2/FIO2 >200 mm Hg (pediatric intensive care units mortality 7.1%) (p = .014). CONCLUSIONS This is the largest study to estimate prospectively the pediatric population-based acute respiratory distress syndrome incidence and the first incidence study performed during the routine application of lung protective ventilation in children. Our findings support a lower acute respiratory distress syndrome incidence and mortality than those reported for adults.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review was performed to identify all osteoid osteoma ablations performed over a 5.5-year period at a single tertiary care pediatric hospital. Twenty-five ablations (15 radiofrequency and 10 microwave) in 23 patients undergoing fluoroscopic CBCT-guided osteoid osteoma ablation were compared to 35 ablations (35 radiofrequency) in 32 patients undergoing ablation via conventional CT guidance. Dose area product and dose length product were recorded for CBCT and conventional CT, respectively, and converted to effective doses. Technical success, clinical success (cessation of pain and medication use 1 month after ablation), complications, radiation dose, and total room utilization time were compared. RESULTS All procedures were technically successful. Twenty-two of 25 (88.0%) CBCT and 31 of 35 (88.6%) conventional CT-guided ablations achieved immediate clinical success. There were two minor complications in each group and no major complications. Mean effective radiation dose was significantly lower for CBCT compared to CT guidance (0.12 vs. 0.39 mSv, p = 0.02). Mean total room utilization time for CBCT was longer (133.5 vs. 97.5 min, p = 0.0001).

A platform consists of a platform core (such as a smartphone operating system, a marketplace or a music streaming service) which is controlled by the platform owner who orchestrates the relationship between customers and providers (e.g. the distribution of goods, apps or music to end-users). Recently, the utilization and monetization of data has been significantly increasing. While some sources report the existence of data platforms as technical repositories to distribute data, the literature is sparse in discussing the role of data in platform ecosystems or outlining the existence of data platform ecosystems. By combining the technical concept of a data platform with the one of a platform ecosystem, a data platform ecosystem emerges. It comprises a platform ecosystem that facilitates the recombination and exchange of data around a stable core between a wide range of complements of data providers and prospective customers. To understand the characteristics of data platform ecosystems, we will elaborate on the concepts of data modularity, data quality, disposal and usage rights of data as well as ways to address the information paradox inherent to data.

DESIGN: Tissue samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antigen using immunofluorescence and for viral RNA by in situ hybridisation. A set of 387 oropharyngeal swabs that had been submitted for routine respiratory pathogen testing was tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Lung tissue collected post-mortem from cat 1 tested positive for both SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen and RNA. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in an oropharyngeal swab collected from cat 2 that presented with rhinitis and conjunctivitis. High throughput sequencing of the viral genome revealed five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared to the nearest UK human SARS-CoV-2 sequence, and this human virus contained eight SNPs compared to the original Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence. An analysis of the viral genome of cat 2 together with nine other feline-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences from around the world revealed no shared cat-specific mutations. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that human-to-cat transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, with the infected cats developing mild or severe respiratory disease.

Multiple image processing techniques are used to extract a region of interest (ROI) from the entire X-ray image. The ImageDataGenerator class is used to overcome the small dataset size and generate ten thousand augmented images. The performance of the proposed approach has been compared with state-of-the-art VGG16, AlexNet, and InceptionV3 models. Results demonstrate that the proposed CNN model outperforms other baseline models with high accuracy values: 97.68% for two classes, 89.85% for three classes, and 84.76% for four classes. This system allows COVID-19 patients to be processed by an automated screening system with minimal human contact.",2022-03-21,"Ahmad, Muhammad; Sadiq, Saima; Eshmawi, Ala’ Abdulmajid; Alluhaidan, Ala Saleh; Umer, Muhammad; Ullah, Saleem; Nappi, Michele",Comput Biol Med,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/825c95d1003e6effb55d5b4eca1f7360b1213e57.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8935962.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35334315/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482522002104; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482522002104; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2022.105418,247584953.0

We aimed to evaluate serological response to BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with haematological malignancies by type of treatment. METHODS: Our national prospective cohort study was done in Lithuania and assessed serological response to one and two BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine doses in healthy health-care workers and in patients with haematological malignancies. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older, had received both vaccine doses, and had available biobanked blood samples from before vaccination and after the second dose. Biobanked samples and health data were obtained from Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos Biobank. Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG Quant II chemiluminescent microparticle assay was used to quantify serum anti-SARS-CoV-2-S1 IgG antibody (anti-S1 IgG antibody) concentrations 0–10 days before the first BNT162b2 vaccine, on the day of second immunisation (around day 21), and 7 to 21 days after the second immunisation. Adverse events were assessed by a standardised questionnaire. Breakthrough infections were characterised clinically and by SARS-CoV-2 genotyping whenever possible. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04871165. FINDINGS: Between Jan 8 and April 21, 2021, 885 participants with haematological malignancies were included in the study. 857 patients were anti-S1 IgG seronegative at timepoint 0 and constituted the main analysis cohort. The age-matched comparison was made between 315 patients with haematological malignancies who were aged 18–60 years and 67 healthy health-care workers in the same age group. Patients aged 18–60 years with haematological malignancies had lower median anti-S1 IgG antibody responses after two BNT162b2 vaccine doses than did health-care workers of the same age group (median 6961 AU/mL [IQR 1292–20 672] vs 21 395 AU/mL [14 831–33 553]; p<0·0001). Compared with untreated patients with haematological malignancies (n=53; median 5761 AU/mL [629–16 141]), patients actively treated with Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKIs; n=44; 0 AU/mL [0–7]; p<0·0001), ruxolitinib (n=16; 10 AU/mL [0–45]; p<0·0001), venetoclax (n=10; 4 AU/mL [0–1218]; p=0·0005), or anti-CD20 antibody therapy (n=87; 17 AU/mL [1–2319]; p<0·0001) showed particularly poor anti-S1 IgG antibody responses following two BNT162b2 doses. Patients being treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (n=41; 10 537 AU/mL [IQR 2335–19 388]) or patients who received autologous haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT; n=192; 6203 AU/mL [1451–16 834]) or allogeneic HSCT (n=122; 6304 AU/mL [1120–16 913]) were among the subgroups with the highest numerical responses. Nine SARS-CoV-2 infections and three COVID-19 deaths were observed among fully vaccinated patients with haematological malignancies. INTERPRETATION: Patients with haematological malignancies mount blunted and heterogeneous antibody responses to the full course of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination. Patients who are actively treated with BTKIs, ruxolitinib, venetoclax, or anti-CD20 antibody therapies seem to be the most negatively affected and might be left unprotected from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Breakthrough severe SARS-CoV-2 infections in fully vaccinated patients with haematological malignancies emphasise the importance of ongoing strict adherence to non-pharmacological interventions and household vaccination while SARS-CoV-2 is circulating in the community.

We sought to examine the association of ABO blood group type with cardiovascular complications in COVID-19. We examined 409 individuals enrolled in the COVID-19 Registry to Assess Frequency, Management, and Outcomes of Arterial and Venous Thromboembolic Complications (CORONA-VTE) who had ABO blood group data available. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the association of ABO blood group types with three primary outcomes: major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), major arterial and venous thrombosis and all-cause mortality. 201, 121, 61 and 26 individuals had blood group O, A, B and AB, respectively. In multivariable analysis, blood group A was associated with a 2.5-fold higher odds of MACE than blood group O (OR 2.47[1.18-5.18]). There was an effect suggesting a 2-fold higher odds of major thrombotic events in blood group A vs. O that did not reach statistical significance (OR 2.15 [0.89-5.20]). No association between blood group type and all-cause mortality was found. Compared with the other blood group types, blood group A was associated with an increased odds of MACE(ORA/non-A 2.18[1.11-4.29]), while blood group O was associated with lower odds of MACE(ORO/non-O 0.50[0.26-0.97]). In conclusion, blood group A was associated with an increased odds of MACE, whereas blood group O was associated with a reduction in the odds of MACE in patients with COVID-19. These findings may inform risk stratification of COVID-19 patients for cardiovascular complications.

This study presents the rehabilitation process of a 43-year-old woman diagnosed with pelvic round cell sarcoma of the right gluteal area during the COVID-19 pandemic. The patient underwent wide excision, buttockectomy and internal hemipelvectomy, and we measured outcomes using the Tinetti assessment tool (TAT) and Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS). A decreased risk of falls and improved functional performance were recorded using the TAT and LEFS respectively.

In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, investigations are ongoing to determine the role of fomites in coronavirus transmission as well. The bacteriophage phi 6 has a phospholipid envelope and is commonly used in environmental studies as a surrogate for human enveloped viruses. The persistence of phi 6 was evaluated as a surrogate for Ebola virus (EBOV) and coronaviruses on porous and nonporous hospital surfaces. Phi 6 was suspended in a body fluid simulant and inoculated onto 1-cm2 coupons of steel, plastic, and two fabric curtain types. The coupons were placed at two controlled absolute humidity (AH) levels: a low AH of 3.0 g/m3 and a high AH of 14.4 g/m3 Phi 6 declined at a lower rate on all materials under low-AH conditions, with a decay rate of 0.06-log10 PFU/day to 0.11-log10 PFU/day, than under the higher AH conditions, with a decay rate of 0.65-log10 PFU/h to 1.42-log10 PFU/day. There was a significant difference in decay rates between porous and nonporous surfaces at both low AH (P < 0.0001) and high AH (P < 0.0001). Under these laboratory-simulated conditions, phi 6 was found to be a conservative surrogate for EBOV under low-AH conditions in that it persisted longer than Ebola virus in similar AH conditions. Additionally, some coronaviruses persist longer than phi 6 under similar conditions; therefore, phi 6 may not be a suitable surrogate for coronaviruses.IMPORTANCE Understanding the persistence of enveloped viruses helps inform infection control practices and procedures in health care facilities and community settings. These data convey to public health investigators that enveloped viruses can persist and remain infective on surfaces, thus demonstrating a potential risk for transmission. Under these laboratory-simulated Western indoor hospital conditions, we assessed the suitability of phi 6 as a surrogate for environmental persistence research related to enveloped viruses, including EBOV and coronaviruses.",2020,"Whitworth, Carrie; Mu, Yi; Houston, Hollis; Martinez-Smith, Marla; Noble-Wang, Judith; Coulliette-Salmond, Angela; Rose, Laura",,,#614748,,,,,220120759.0
zgaoeejn,,WHO,Make this tango viral: Touching toward the untouchable in tele- synaesthesia performance,10.1386/jcca_00046_1,,,unk,"The COVID-19 pandemic has created an uncanny rift between tact and touch as it expands the virtual towards its potential. Layer upon layer of new information has been repeatedly revising and reformulating our sense of touch. The uncondi-tional freedom of touch needs to be rendered accountable in this rift of time and space. The act of touching entails individual acknowledging the risk of reaching towards the unknown or the known. Tracing with a tactile sense of touch is to be tactful about how, where and what can such act of touching could reach, especially in the context of communicative technology. This article focuses on the possibil-ity of virtual sensibility by challenging ways to feel touched beyond the nostal-gic narratives that attempt to indict communicative technology with the loss of touch. To replenish and reinstate touch through tele-synaesthesia performance, I ask: how to elongate our somatosensensation and echo the embodied experience of touching through virtual connectivity? Tele-synaesthesia performance joints tele-matic and synaesthetic experience together to embody the incorporeality of touch through virtual connectivity. It embodies the injunction of physical contact and challenges what can and cannot be touched by suturing one sensuous modality to another. Inspired by Paul Sermon's artistic production of Telematic Quarantine (2020) and Pandemic Encounters (2020), that tele-presents the stories of self (isolation), I have created The Best Facial (2021): a series of one-to-one participatory tele-synaesthesia performances, where I became a virtual aesthetician and performed 'virtual facial care' on Zoom amid the second wave of the pandemic in the United Kingdom. In this article, I will discuss how tele-synaesthesia performance could trigger tactile experiences in the participants in reference to Michel Foucault's concept Heterotopia (1986) that allegorically address the incompatible physical places in the society. I discuss how to elicit an affective sensory response from non-tactile senses through virtual touch, as stated by Naomi Bennett's 'Telematic connections: sensing, feeling, being in space together' (2020). I refer to Legacy Russell's discussion on glitch (2020) to analyse the possible future of tele-synaesthesia performance and its potential for expanding virtual connectivity with an ethical touch of a non-performative refusal of the present.",2021,"Hao, A.

Numerous studies have shown that selenium (Se) plays an important role in promoting plant growth, although Se has not been considered an essential element for higher plants. The objectives of this research were to determine the effects of foliar Se application (0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0 and 20.0 mg m(−2) Se in sodium selenite, sprayed monthly from May to August) on the growth and rhizospheric soil micro-ecological environment of A. macrocephala, and explore the possible mechanisms underlying plant response to foliar Se application through a field experiment. The results were: The foliar application of 5.0 mg m(−2) Se significantly increased the survival rate of A. macrocephala compared to the control. The yield of A. macrocephala was increased when the Se level maintained belowed 10.0 mg m(−2) but decreased when Se level reached 20.0 mg m(−2). The Se content in the rhizome of A. macrocephala showed a significant positive correlation with the Se level, while the insect attack rate was significantly negatively correlated with the Se level. However, foliar Se application hardly affected the concentration of bioactive compound atractylenolide in the rhizome of A. macrocephala. Notably, the application of foliar Se changed the content of partial soil nutrients, microbial diversity and composition in the rhizosphere soil of A. macrocephala. Bacterial diversity was positively correlated with A. macrocephala growth whereas fungal diversity was negatively correlated, suggesting that microbial diversity in the rhizosphere soils is closely related to plant growth. Moreover, correlation analysis showed that available potassium, Burkholderia and Cupriavidus in rhizospheric soil might be critical factors for promoting the growth of A. macrocephala. Overall, the foliar application of Se at moderate concentration was beneficial for the growth of A. macrocephala, and 5.0-10.0 mg m(−2) Se level was the optimum. Our findings revealed novel insights into the response of A. macrocephala to foliar Se application from plant growth, rhizospheric soil nutrient and microbial community composition .",2020-10-22,"Zhou, Wuxian; Duan, Yuanyuan; Zhang, Yajuan; Wang, Hua; Huang, Donghai; Zhang, Meide",S Afr J Bot,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/08aaaa8a568e380883bf9462a10585a711c49d54.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7578779.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33106718/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2020.09.032; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0254629920311029; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0254629920311029,224818429.0

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the results obtained with video-assisted surgery (VATS) in benign disease are comparable to those obtained in oncologic surgery, where VATS has been validated. METHODS We have reviewed the files of 246 consecutive patients who underwent VATS lobectomy from January 2012 to August 2015. The cohort was divided into two groups according to pathology (benign or malignant). Outcome parameters on scrutiny were demographics, pathology, duration of air leak, drainage and hospital stay, conversion, and perioperative complication rate. Comparisons were made with the χ 2 test and Student's t test; any p value ≤0.05 was considered as significant. RESULTS Group 1 (36 patients) included patients who underwent lobectomy for benign disease and group 2 (210 patients) patients affected by lung cancer or pulmonary metastases. The two groups differed with reference to age (p < 0.001), history of cancer (p < 0.001), history of stroke (p = 0.05), and the presence of pleural adhesions (p = 0.03). There was no difference for duration of air leaks, chest tube drainage and hospital stay, conversion rate, and perioperative complication rate.

To estimate the critical care bed capacity that would be required to admit all critical COVID-19 cases in a setting of unchecked SARS-CoV-2 transmission, both with and without elderly-specific protection measures.Methods. Using electronic health records of all 2432 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a large hospital in Madrid, Spain, between February 28 and April 23, 2020, we estimated the number of critical care beds needed to admit all critical care patients. To mimic a hypothetical intervention that halves SARS-CoV-2 infections among the elderly, we randomly excluded 50% of patients aged 65 years and older.Results. Critical care requirements peaked at 49 beds per 100 000 on April 1-2 weeks after the start of a national lockdown. After randomly excluding 50% of elderly patients, the estimated peak was 39 beds per 100 000.Conclusions. Under unchecked SARS-CoV-2 transmission, peak critical care requirements in Madrid were at least fivefold higher than prepandemic capacity. Under a hypothetical intervention that halves infections among the elderly, critical care peak requirements would have exceeded the prepandemic capacity of most high-income countries.Public Health Implications.

This coronavirus is a virulent mutant of the harmless, ubiquitous feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). To date, feline coronavirus (FCoV) research has been hampered by the lack of susceptible cell lines for the propagation of serotype I FCoVs. In this study, long-term feline intestinal epithelial cell cultures were established from primary ileocytes and colonocytes by simian virus 40 (SV40) T-antigen- and human Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (hTERT)-induced immortalization. Subsequently, these cultures were evaluated for their usability in FCoV research. Firstly, the replication capacity of the serotype II strains WSU 79–1683 and WSU 79–1146 was studied in the continuous cultures as was done for the primary cultures. In accordance with the results obtained in primary cultures, FCoV WSU 79–1683 still replicated significantly more efficient compared to FCoV WSU 79–1146 in both continuous cultures. In addition, the cultures were inoculated with faecal suspensions from healthy cats and with faecal or tissue suspensions from FIP cats. The cultures were susceptible to infection with different serotype I enteric strains and two of these strains were further propagated. No infection was seen in cultures inoculated with FIPV tissue homogenates. In conclusion, a new reliable model for FCoV investigation and growth of enteric field strains was established. In contrast to FIPV strains, FECVs showed a clear tropism for intestinal epithelial cells, giving an explanation for the observation that FECV is the main pathotype circulating among cats.",2013-08-21,"Desmarets, Lowiese MB; Theuns, Sebastiaan; Olyslaegers, Dominique AJ; Dedeurwaerder, Annelike; Vermeulen, Ben L; Roukaerts, Inge DM; Nauwynck, Hans J",Vet Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/39ab5e6b24f55e696076c53f96fc5704ff3ff0f0.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3765525.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1186/1297-9716-44-71; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23964891/,18416243.0

ath3tlqq,,WHO,Comparison of optimal distribution route for personal protection equipment by saving matrix and tabu search methods using nearest neighbor approach at covid-19 referral hospitals in west java,,,,unk,"At the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the disease was spread across the universe. This virus has level of blistering transmission because it can be transmitted through the air. To contain the outbreak, the people need to be self-isolated to minimize interaction with other people. In this case, the health workers are on the front line to combat this COVID-19 pandemic. It is because they must be dealing with the affected patients directly by taking care of them during their self-isolation period. The health workers must wear personal protective equipment (PPE) to avoid the virus transmission. In this turmoil, the availability of personal protective equipment or PPE is quite worrying. Therefore, the Indonesian government and every government around the world are arm in arm organize a worldwide aid in the form of PPE distribution through referral hospitals, with the objective of making the health workers safer. This research is aimed at conducting a simulation of distribution to obtain PPE route distribution in a more effective and efficient ways to get an optimal route. In this case, this research had been conducted by comparing two methods: Saving matrix and tabu search for Hazmat suit distribution. Apart from getting an optimal route, the cost and time could be pushed more effectively to clock the fastest time in distribution with the fewest cost of distribution. The simulation of distribution point used was Distribution Center of West Java as an origin point, specifically at the COVID-19 referral hospitals in West Java, which was listed on the PIKOBAR site as the beneficiary of the PPE and the data of health workers in West Java mentioned in Central Agency on Statistics or locally known as BPS as the determinant of the requested PPE numbers. The result of this research showed that Tabu Search method was more optimal compared to Saving Matrix method based on similar approach, Nearest Neighbor, in determining the route that resulted in four distribution routes. This study showed that Saving Matrix research method concluded a mileage of 2.404 km in 80 hours at the cost of Rp. 10.505.968, while Tabu Search concluded a mileage of 2.351 km in 78 hours at the cost of Rp. 10.437.492. © 2021 Karadeniz Technical University.

Bioinformatic screens based largely on the presence of both a C-terminal consensus sequence and an adjacent gene encoding a cognate immunity protein identified 13 potential antibacterial effectors, most of which were highly conserved among sequenced strains of S. maltophilia. The immunity proteins of two of these proved especially capable of protecting P. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli against attack from the Stenotrophomonas T4SS. In turn, S. maltophilia mutants lacking the putative effectors RS14245 and RS14255 were impaired for killing not only laboratory E. coli but clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, including ones isolated from the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. That complemented mutants behaved as wild type did confirmed that RS14245 and RS14255 are required for the bactericidal activity of the S. maltophilia T4SS. Moreover, a mutant lacking both of these proteins was as impaired as a mutant lacking the T4SS apparatus, indicating that RS14245 and RS14255 account for (nearly) all of the bactericidal effects seen. Utilizing an interbacterial protein translocation assay, we determined that RS14245 and RS14255 are bona fide substrates of the T4SS, a result confirmed by examination of mutants lacking both the T4SS and the individual effectors. Delivery of the cloned 14245 protein (alone) into the periplasm resulted in the killing of target bacteria, indicating that this effector, a putative lipase, is both necessary and sufficient for bactericidal activity.",2021-06-29,"Nas, Megan Y.; Gabell, Jeffrey; Cianciotto, Nicholas P.",mBio,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7f742f2fb14823ea7a1e380c16607ca8c3ed23ba.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8262851.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34182776/; https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01502-21,235673060.0

An alternative algorithm adapted to the intensive care unit (ICU) population has been proposed (AspICU), but this algorithm did not include microbial biomarkers such as the galactomannan antigen and the Aspergillus quantitative PCR. The objective of the present pilot study was to evaluate a new algorithm that includes fungal biomarkers (BM-AspICU) for the diagnosis of probable IPA in an ICU population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 35 patients with pathology-proven IPA according to European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycosis Study Group (EORTC/MSGERC)-2008 criteria were extracted from the French multicenter database of the Invasive Fungal Infections Surveillance Network (RESSIF). The patients were investigated according to the AspICU algorithm, and the BM-AspICU algorithm in analyzing the clinical, imaging, and biomarker data available in the records, without taking into account the pathology findings. RESULTS: Eight patients had to be excluded because no imaging data were recorded in the database. Among the 27 proven IPAs with complete data, 16 would have been considered as putative IPA with the AspICU algorithm and 24 would have been considered as probable IPA using the new algorithm BM-AspICU. Seven out of the 8 patients with probable BM-AspICU IPA (and not classified with the AspICU algorithm) had no host factors and no Aspergillus-positive broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) culture. Three patients were non-classifiable with any of the two algorithms, because they did not have any microbial criteria during the course of the infection, and diagnosis of proven aspergillosis was done using autopsy samples.

Here, we show that this three-step modification pathway exists in Dictyostelium discoideum, model of the evolutionary superfamily Amoebozoa. Not only are previously established modifications observable by mass spectrometry in strains with the most conserved genes of each step deleted, but also additional modifications are detected, indicating a certain plasticity of the pathway in the amoeba. Unlike described for yeast, D. discoideum allows for an unconditional deletion of the single tQCUG gene, as long as the Elongator-dependent modification pathway is intact. In gene deletion strains of the modification pathway, protein amounts are significantly reduced as shown by flow cytometry and Western blotting, using strains expressing different glutamine leader constructs fused to GFP. Most dramatic are these effects, when the tQCUG gene is deleted, or Elp3, the catalytic component of the Elongator complex is missing. In addition, Elp3 is the most strongly conserved protein of the modification pathway, as our phylogenetic analysis reveals.

While there were mathematical models of COVID-19 transmission, there were no established or tested protocols of COVID-19 testing or mitigation for school administrators to follow. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of a multifaceted COVID-19 mitigation strategy using social, behavioral, and educational interventions and a program of frequent testing with prevalence of disease spread. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was conducted as a retrospective review of COVID-19 positivity from August 16, 2020, to April 30, 2021, at Delaware State University, a publicly funded historically Black university. Participants included all students, faculty, and staff members with a campus presence. Positivity rates after use of mitigation strategies and testing on campus were compared with those of the surrounding community. Data were analyzed from July through September 2021. EXPOSURES: Mitigation strategies included education and outreach about social distancing, masking, and handwashing, and a COVID-19 testing plan consisted of twice-weekly polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening using anterior nasal samples (fall and early spring semester) and then saliva-based samples (middle to late spring semester). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cumulative tests, infections, daily quarantine, and isolation residence hall occupancy were measured, and comparisons were made with statewide COVID-19 positivity rates. RESULTS: The campus cohort included 2320 individuals (1575 resident students, 415 nonresident students, and 330 faculty or staff members). There were 1488 (64.1%) women and 832 (35.9%) men; mean (SD) age was 27.5 (12.9) years. During the fall semester, 36 500 COVID-19 PCR tests were performed. Weekly positivity rates ranged from 0 of 372 tests to 16 of 869 tests (1.8%) (mean [SD] positivity rate, 0.5% [0.5%]; 168 positive results and 36 312 negative results). During the same period, statewide positivity ranged from 589 of 25 120 tests (2.3%) to 5405 of 54 596 tests (9.9%) (mean [SD] positivity rate, 4.8% [2.6%]). In the spring semester, 39 045 PCR tests were performed. Weekly positivity rates ranged from 4 of 2028 tests (0.2%) to 36 of 900 tests (4.0%) (mean [SD] positivity rate, 0.8% [0.9%]; 267 positive results and 38 767 negative results). During the same period, statewide positivity ranged from 1336 of 37 254 tests (3.6%) to 3630 of 42 458 tests (8.5%) (mean [SD] positivity rate, 5.1% [1.3%]). Compared with statewide rates, campus positivity rates were mean (SD) 4.4 (2.6) percentage points lower during the fall semester (P < .001) and mean (SD) 5.6 (1.6) percentage points lower during the spring semester (P < .001). Total daily quarantine and isolation residence hall occupancy ranged from 0 to 43 students in the fall and 1 to 47 students during the spring. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that the combination of campuswide mitigation policies and twice-weekly COVID-19 PCR screening was associated with a significant decrease in COVID-19 positivity at a residential historically Black university campus compared with the surrounding community. Given the socioeconomic demographics of many students at historically Black colleges and universities, keeping these resident campuses open is critical not only to ensure access to educational resources, but also to provide housing and food security.",2021-12-13,"Hockstein, Neil G.; Moultrie, LaKresha; Fisher, Michelle; Mason, R.

We assessed whether there was an impact of immunizations on the mortality of individuals aged 80+ years. Methods By April 22, 2021, 147,454 COVID-19 deaths had been reported to the Brazilian Mortality Information System. Denominators for mortality rates were calculated by correcting population estimates for all-cause deaths reported in 2020. Proportionate mortality at ages 80+ and 90+ years relative to deaths at all ages were calculated, and mortality rate ratios compared these two age groups with individuals aged 0-79 years. Vaccine coverage data were obtained from the Ministry of Health vaccination monitoring website. All results were tabulated by two-week periods from epidemiological weeks 1-14, 2021. Findings As the P.1 variant spread throughout Brazil, the total number of deaths increased over time starting in epidemiological week 9 of 2021. The proportion of all deaths occurring at ages 80+ years was over 25% in weeks 1-6 and declined rapidly to 13.1% in weeks 13-14. Mortality rates were over 13 times higher in the 80+ years age group compared to that of 0-79 year olds up to week 6, and declined to 6.9 times in weeks 13-14. Coronavac accounted for 77.3% and AstraZeneca for 15.9% of all doses administered. Vaccination coverage (first dose) increased rapidly among individuals aged 80+ years, reaching 49.1% in weeks 5-6 and over 90% after week 9. Interpretation Rapid scaling up of vaccination coverage among elderly Brazilians was associated with an important decline in relative mortality compared to younger individuals, in a setting where the P.1 variant predominates. Had mortality rates among the elderly remained proportionate to what was observed up to week 6, an estimated additional 13,824 deaths would have been expected up to week 14.",2021-04-30,"Victora, C.

We focused on receptors involved in interactions between immune cells and virus-infected cells. We found that the diversity of receptor repertoires on natural killer (NK) cells was negatively correlated with the viral clearance rate. In addition, NK subsets expressing the receptor DNAM1 were increased in patients who more rapidly recovered from infection. Ex vivo functional studies revealed that NK subpopulations with high DNAM1 expression had cytolytic activities in response to target cell stimulation. We also found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced the expression of CD155 and nectin-4, ligands of DNAM1 and its paired coinhibitory receptor TIGIT, which counterbalanced the cytolytic activities of NK cells.

9xabgp3a,,WHO,The anti-inflammatory cytokine response characterized by elevated interleukin-10 is a stronger predictor of severe disease and poor outcomes than the pro-inflammatory cytokine response in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),,,,unk,"OBJECTIVES: Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a dysregulated immune state. While research has focused on the hyperinflammation, little research has been performed on the compensatory anti-inflammatory response. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory cytokine response to COVID-19, by assessing interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IL-10/lymphocyte count ratio and their association with outcomes. METHODS: Adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were recruited. The primary endpoint was maximum COVID-19 severity within 30 days of index ED visit. RESULTS: A total of 52 COVID-19 patients were enrolled. IL-10 and IL-10/lymphocyte count were significantly higher in patients with severe disease (p<0.05), as well as in those who developed severe acute kidney injury (AKI) and new positive bacterial cultures (all p&#8804;0.01). In multivariable analysis, a one-unit increase in IL-10 and IL-10/lymphocyte count were associated with 42% (p=0.031) and 32% (p=0.013) increased odds, respectively, of severe COVID-19. When standardized to a one-unit standard deviations scale, an increase in the IL-10 was a stronger predictor of maximum 30-day severity and severe AKI than increases in IL-6 or IL-8. CONCLUSIONS: The hyperinflammatory response to COVID-19 is accompanied by a simultaneous anti-inflammatory response, which is associated with poor outcomes and may increase the risk of new positive bacterial cultures. IL-10 and IL-10/lymphocyte count at ED presentation were independent predictors of COVID-19 severity.

CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is more severe in children with comorbid conditions. Fever, respiratory and gastrointestinal (GIT) symptoms were predominant presenting symptoms. MIS-C is of increasing concern in children with high mortality rates.

Bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics, albeit with increasing difficulty as many of the more common causes of infection have now developed broad spectrum antimicrobial resistance. However, there is now an even greater challenge from both old and new viruses capable of causing respiratory, enteric, and urogenital infections. Reports of viruses resistant to frontline therapeutic drugs are steadily increasing and there is an urgent need to develop novel antiviral agents. Although this all makes sense, it seems rather strange that relatively little attention has been given to the antiviral capabilities of probiotics. Over the years, beneficial strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been successfully used to treat gastrointestinal, oral, and vaginal infections, and some can also effect a reduction in serum cholesterol levels. Some probiotics prevent gastrointestinal dysbiosis and, by doing so, reduce the risk of developing secondary infections. Other probiotics exhibit anti-tumor and immunomodulating properties, and in some studies, antiviral activities have been reported for probiotic bacteria and/or their metabolites. Unfortunately, the mechanistic basis of the observed beneficial effects of probiotics in countering viral infections is sometimes unclear. Interestingly, in COVID-19 patients, a clear decrease has been observed in cell numbers of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium spp., both of which are common sources of intestinal probiotics. The present review, specifically motivated by the need to implement effective new counters to SARS-CoV-2, focusses attention on viruses capable of co-infecting humans and other animals and specifically explores the potential of probiotic bacteria and their metabolites to intervene with the process of virus infection. The goal is to help to provide a more informed background for the planning of future probiotic-based antiviral research.",2020-08-20,"Tiwari, Santosh Kumar; Dicks, Leon M.

Objective evaluation of olfactory and gustatory disturbances was elicited using the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC) test and gustatory function testing. Furthermore, OHRQoL was assessed using Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14). Results More than half of the patients (62%) had some form of olfactory dysfunction/alteration, and 42% had poor CCCRC scores. About 14% reported ageusia, while 68% reported some form of taste alterations, and 55% reported poor OHRQoL. A statistically significant difference was reported between different ABO blood groups and subjective loss of smell (p < 0.05). The subjective loss of taste, CCCRC score, and dysgeusia were found to be independent of OHIP-14 (p > 0.05), but the taste intensity score was dependent on OHIP 14 (p < 0.05). Moreover, a majority (70.8% and 70.0%) with poor OHIP-14 scores had taste intensity scores of 3 and 4, respectively, while those with moderate (68.4% and 48.6%) OHIP-14 had scored 1 and 2, respectively.

This study aimed to verify an association between mortality and the energy and protein provided to critically ill patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 and receiving enteral nutrition support. METHODS: Patients with confirmed COVID-19, with >7 days of stay in the ICU, on enteral nutrition were followed from the moment of hospitalization until discharge from the ICU or death. Data about age, gender, Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS3), intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, days on mechanical ventilation (MV), clinical endpoint outcome (discharge or death), and daily energy and protein provision were collected from electronic medical records. Cox regression analyses and Kaplan-Meyer curves were used in statistical analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients (66.2 ± 13.1 years; 53.8% women) were enrolled in the present study. The mean length of hospitalizations and SAPS3 score were 17.8 ± 9.8 days and 78.7 ± 14.7, respectively; all patients needed mechanical ventilation (mean of days was 16.42 ± 9.1). For most patients (73.1%) the endpoint was death. Twenty-five percent of patients had protein supply >0.8 g/IBW/day. Survival during COVID-19 hospitalization at ICU was significantly different among patients according to protein supply (p = 0.005). Hazard Ratios (HR) for protein supply showed that a protein intake >0.8 g/IBW/day was associated with significantly lower mortality (HR 0.322, p = 0.049). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that a protein supply at least > 0.8 g/IBW/day could be related to reduced mortality in ICU patients with COVID-19.",2021-07-16,"Silvah, Jose Henrique; de Lima, Cristiane Maria Martires; Nicoletti, Carolina Ferreira; Barbosa, Ana Carolina; Junqueira, Gizela Pedroso; da Cunha, Selma Freire de Carvalho; Marchini, Julio Sergio",Clin Nutr ESPEN,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/9062314e06b431033babbd759331d4a06925fd78.json; document_parses/pdf_json/c7fe670393ecbb0ae8c100d3eabc6daf7fe44ab2.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8282450.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.07.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405457721002497; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405457721002497?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34620363/,235915159.0

The zeta potential values of complexes changed from negative to positive with the increase of pea protein as a result of positively charged complexes formation. The increase in the ratio of pea protein/hydrolysates also resulted in increased turbidity in all samples. Particle size measurements indicated that the complexes tended to form larger aggregates (ranged from 61.5 ± 1.7 μm to 183 ± 2.8 μm). The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity of the pea protein/fish protein hydrolysate complexes was higher than that of the protein hydrolysates alone. Moreover, increasing levels of pea protein did not affect the antioxidant activity of fish protein hydrolysates. The complexes of the Paralonchurus brasiliensis were chosen for the microencapsulation process by spray-drying. The results revealed that spray-drying did not have a significant effect (P > 0.05) on the protein hydrolysate antioxidant activity when they were complexed with pea protein. Thus, this work suggests that the complexation with pea protein and subsequent microencapsulation by spray-drying is an efficient way to protect the biological activity of protein hydrolysates obtained from bycatch.

However, RCTs are costly and time-consuming to perform and long-term follow-up of participants may be hampered by lost contacts and financial constraints. Advances in computing and population-based registries have created new possibilities for increasing the value of RCTs by post-trial extension using linkage to routinely collected administrative/registry data in order to determine long-term interventional effects. There have been recent important examples, including 20+ years follow-up studies of trials of pravastatin and mammography. Despite the potential value of post-trial extension, there has been no systematic study of this literature. This scoping review aims to characterise published post-trial extension studies, assess their value, and identify any potential challenges associated with this approach. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This review will use the recommended methods for scoping reviews. We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. A draft search strategy is included in this protocol. Review of titles and abstracts, full texts of potentially eligible studies and data/information extraction will be conducted independently by pairs of investigators. Eligible studies will be RCTs that investigated healthcare interventions that were extended by individual linkage to administrative/registry/electronic medical records data after the completion of the planned follow-up period. Information concerning the original trial, characteristics of the extension study, any clinical, policy or ethical implications and methodological or practical challenges will be collected using standardised forms. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION As this study uses secondary data, and does not include person-level data, ethics approval is not required. We aim to disseminate these findings through journals and conferences targeting triallists and researchers involved in health data linkage. We aim to produce guidance for investigators on the conduct of post-trial extensions using routinely collected data.",2017,"Fitzpatrick, Tiffany; Perrier, Laure; Tricco, Andrea C; Straus, Sharon E; Jüni, Peter; Zwarenstein, Merrick; Lix, Lisa M; Smith, Mark; Rosella, Laura C; Henry, David A",BMJ open,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013770; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28213601/,17952577.0

The outcomes of these patients, for whom endotracheal intubation is not mandatory, depend on the degree of hypoxia, the presence of comorbidities and complications, and their illness severity. The use of NIV as an alternative to invasive ventilation in severely hypoxemic patients with ARDS (ie, P(aO(2))/F(IO(2)) < 200) is not generally advisable and should be limited to hemodynamically stable patients who can be closely monitored in an intensive care unit by highly skilled staff. Early NIV application may be extremely helpful in immunocompromised patients with pulmonary infiltrates, in whom intubation dramatically increases the risk of infection, pneumonia, and death. The use of NIV in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome and other airborne diseases has generated debate, despite encouraging clinical results, mainly because of safety issues. Overall, the high rate of NIV failure suggests a cautious approach to NIV use in patients with ALI/ARDS, including early initiation, intensive monitoring, and prompt intubation if signs of NIV failure emerge.",2011,"Nava, Stefano; Schreiber, Ania; Domenighetti, Guido",Respiratory care,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.01209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22008399/,26631406.0
lidko45u,,WHO,Browning and quality management of pear fruit by salicylic acid treatment during low temperature storage,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: ""Patharnakh"" pear, a dominant cultivar in the Punjab province of India, has a shorter storage life as it matures during the hot and humid weather. Studies have reported that postharvest chemical treatments have a major role in improving the storage life of the fruit. In this study, the efficacy of different concentrations (1, 2, and 3 mM) of salicylic acid (SA), a well-known signaling molecule, was explored to overcome browning and maintain the postharvest quality of the Patharnakh pear during cold storage. RESULTS: SA treated pears were better than the untreated fruits in all of the studied parameters. SA application alleviated the rate of weight loss and respiration, and lowered the decay percentage. The efficacy of SA in the reduction of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, which correlates negatively with the total phenolic content, was quite noticeable. The SA treated fruits exhibited a slower oxidation of the total phenol content by inhibiting the action of polyphenol oxidase and retaining the total phenolic content, leading to lower incidence of browning. SA effectively maintained the ascorbic acid content and superoxide dismutase activity. Total soluble solids, titratable acidity, ascorbic acid, and pH of the pears were highest with the SA treatment. CONCLUSION: The 2 mM SA treatment exhibited the best result of reducing fruit decay and tissue browning, and maintaining the postharvest quality parameters of pear up to 60 days of cold storage.

The infection impairs several human organs and systems, however, it is not clear how it affects thyroid function. The study therefore aimed at measuring plasma levels of thyroid hormones and Hs-CRP in COVID-19 patients and apparently healthy uninfected controls to assess the possible effect of SAR-CoV-2 infection on thyroid function. METHODS: in this cross-sectional study carried out between May-August 2020, 90 consenting participants comprising 45 COVID-19 patients and 45 apparently healthy uninfected controls were recruited. Plasma FT3, FT4, TSH and Hs-CRP were measured using Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method. Data was analysed using SPSS version 20 and statistical significance set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: the mean plasma FT3 and TSH concentrations were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (p < 0.001, p < 0.001 respectively). Euthyroidism was observed in all uninfected controls, whereas 35 (77.8%) COVID-19 patients were euthyroid. Sick euthyroid and subclinical hypothyroidism was observed in 7 (15.6%) and 3 (6.7%) COVID-19 patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: though there was a preponderance of euthyroidism among COVID-19 patients, significantly higher mean plasma levels of TSH and FT3, sick euthyroid syndrome and subclinical hypothyroidism observed among some COVID-19 patients may be indicative of disease-related thyroid function changes.

afrzk16o,,WHO,Recent progress and challenges in drug development against COVID-19 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) - an update on the status,,,,unk,"Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses known to cause illnesses that vary between the common cold and more severe diseases to include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). A novel coronavirus was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. This virus represents a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The virus is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting disease is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic in March 2020. Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 continues to rise, with more than 1,948,617 laboratory-confirmed cases and over 121,846 deaths worldwide. Currently, no specific medication is recommended to treat COVID-19 patients. However, governments and pharmaceutical companies are struggling to quickly find an effective drug to defeat the coronavirus. In the current review, we summarize the existing state of knowledge about COVID-19, available medications, and treatment options. Favilavir is an antiviral drug that is approved in Japan for common influenza treatment and is now approved to treat symptoms of COVID-19 in China. Moreover, Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, drugs used to treat malaria and arthritis, respectively, were recommended by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for treatment of COVID-19. Presently, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are under investigation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for COVID-19.

This perspecitve may be especially important to study among adolescents, who are less likely to experience severe symptoms but contribute to the spread of the virus. Objective: To examine psychological factors associated with adolescents' behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This self-reported survey conducted from March 20 to 22, 2020, recruited a population-based sample of adolescents via social media to complete an anonymous survey. Participants were eligible if they had internet access, lived in the United States, and were aged 13 to 18 years. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes included COVID-19 news monitoring, social distancing, disinfecting, and hoarding behaviors during the 7 days after the United States declared a national emergency. The psychological factors were attitudes about COVID-19 severity, social responsibility values, social trust, and self-interest. The a priori hypotheses were that greater attitudes about the severity of COVID-19, greater social responsibility, and greater social trust would be associated with greater news monitoring, social distancing, and disinfecting, whereas greater self-interest would be associated with more hoarding. Results: The sample included 770 adolescents collected via convenience sampling (mean [SD] age, 16.3 [1.1] years; 575 girls [74.7%]). Many teens reported not engaging in pure social distancing (528 [68.6%]), but they were monitoring the news (688 [89.4%]) and disinfecting daily (676 [87.8%]). Some teens reported hoarding (152 [19.7%]). Attitudes about the greater severity of COVID-19 were associated with more social distancing (ß = 0.18; 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.25), disinfecting (ß = 0.16; 95% CI = 0.08 to 0.23), and news monitoring (ß = 0.26; 95% CI = 0.18 to 0.33) but also more hoarding (ß = 0.08; 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.16). Greater social responsibility was associated with more disinfecting (ß = 0.24; 95% CI = 0.17 to 0.32) and news monitoring (ß = 0.14; 95% CI = 0.07 to 0.22) and less hoarding (ß = -0.07; 95% CI = -0.14 to -0.01). Greater self-interest values were associated with less social distancing (ß = -0.08; 95% CI = -0.15 to -0.01) and more hoarding (ß = 0.08; 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.15). Greater social trust was associated with less hoarding (ß = -0.09; 95% CI, -0.16 to -0.02). Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this survey study suggest that emphasizing the severity of COVID-19 and the social implications of pandemic-related behaviors may be important for teens, particularly for those who are not following preventive health behaviors or who are engaging in hoarding.",2020,"Oosterhoff, Benjamin; Palmer, Cara A",JAMA pediatr.

Materiales y métodos: Este estudio se realizó de forma retrospectiva en 68 pacientes COVID-19 con enfermedad crónica que fueron tratados por diferentes protocolos terapéuticos. Los pacientes se clasificaron en cuatro grupos: el grupo de control representaba los resultados de laboratorio de los pacientes en el momento de la admisión antes de que se aplicaran los protocolos de tratamiento; el grupo 1 incluyó a pacientes tratados con anticoagulantes, Hidroxicloroquina y antibióticos; el grupo 2 estaba compuesto por pacientes tratados con Dexametasona; y el grupo 3 incluyó a pacientes tratados con Dexametasona y Tocilizumab. Resultados: Los recuentos de glóbulos blancos y neutrófilos aumentaron significativamente en el grupo 3 tras el tratamiento cuando se compararon con los pacientes del grupo 1 (p= 0,004 y p= 0,001, respectivamente). La comparación del nivel de proteína C reactiva (CRP) al ingreso fue mayor en el grupo 3 que en el grupo 1 con p= 0.030.

Obtaining a diagnosis of the causal pathogens is challenging but the use of high-throughput real-time PCR (rtPCR) may help target preventive and therapeutic interventions. The aim of this study was to improve the interpretation of rtPCR results by analysing their associations with clinical observations. The objective was to develop and illustrate a field-data driven statistical method to guide the selection of relevant quantification cycle cut-off values for pathogens associated with BRD for the high-throughput rtPCR system “Fluidigm BioMark HD” based on nasal swabs from calves. We used data from 36 herds enrolled in a Danish field study where 340 calves within pre-determined age-groups were subject to clinical examination and nasal swabs up to four times. The samples were analysed with the rtPCR system. Each of the 1,025 observation units were classified as sick with BRD or healthy, based on clinical scores. The optimal rtPCR results to predict BRD were investigated for Pasteurella multocida, Mycoplasma bovis, Histophilus somni, Mannheimia haemolytica, and Trueperella pyogenes by interpreting scatterplots and results of mixed effects logistic regression models. The clinically relevant rtPCR cut-off suggested for P. multocida and M. bovis was ≤ 21.3. For H. somni it was ≤ 17.4, while no cut-off could be determined for M. haemolytica and T. pyogenes. The demonstrated approach can provide objective support in the choice of clinically relevant cut-offs.

In this article, the binding interface was obtained by analyzing the interaction modes between 2019-nCoV coronavirus and the human specific target protein ACE2. Based on the ""SIFT server"" and the ""bubble"" identification mechanism, 9 amino acid sites were selected as potential mutation-sites from the 2019-nCoV-S1-ACE2 binding interface. Subsequently, one total number of 171 mutant systems for 9 mutation-sites were optimized for binding-pattern comparsion analysis, and 14 mutations that may improve the binding capacity of 2019-nCoV-S1 to ACE2 were selected. The Molecular Dynamic Simulations were conducted to calculate the binding free energies of all 14 mutant systems. Finally, we found that most of the 14 mutations on the 2019-nCoV-S1 protein could enhance the binding ability between the 2019-nCoV coronavirus and the human protein ACE2. Among which, the binding capacities for G446R, Y449R and F486Y mutations could be increased by 20%, and that for S494R mutant increased even by 38.98%.

Due to the easy access, low cost, and faster reach of the information, people search out and devour news from online social networks. In contrast, the increasing acceptance of social media reporting leads to the spread of fake news. This is a minacious problem that causes disputes and endangers the societal stability and harmony. Fake news spread has gained attention from researchers due to its vicious nature. proliferation of misinformation in all media, from the internet to cable news, paid advertising and local news outlets, has made it essential for people to identify the misinformation and sort through the facts. Researchers are trying to analyze the credibility of information and curtail false information on such platforms. Credibility is the believability of the piece of information at hand. Analyzing the credibility of fake news is challenging due to the intent of its creation and the polychromatic nature of the news. In this work, we propose a model for detecting fake news. Our method investigates the content of the news at the early stage i.e., when the news is published but is yet to be disseminated through social media. Our work interprets the content with automatic feature extraction and the relevance of the text pieces. In summary, we introduce stance as one of the features along with the content of the article and employ the pre-trained contextualized word embeddings BERT to obtain the state-of-art results for fake news detection.

ndjvsqe8,,WHO,Lessons from the pandemic on the value of research infrastructure,,,,unk,"The COVID-19 pandemic has shed a spotlight on the resilience of healthcare systems, and their ability to cope efficiently and effectively with unexpected crises. If we are to learn one economic lesson from the pandemic, arguably it is the perils of an overfocus on short-term allocative efficiency at the price of lack of capacity to deal with uncertain future challenges. In normal times, building spare capacity with 'option value' into health systems may seem inefficient, the costs potentially exceeding the benefits. Yet the fatal weakness of not doing so is that this can leave health systems highly constrained when dealing with unexpected, but ultimately inevitable, shocks-such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we argue that the pandemic has highlighted the potentially enormous option value of biomedical research infrastructure. We illustrate this with reference to COVID-19 response work supported by the United Kingdom National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre. As the world deals with the fallout from the most serious economic crisis since the Great Depression, pressure will soon come to review government expenditure, including research funding.

Studies with more patients are needed to clarify the maintenance rate of postoperative hearing function and to identify prognostic of hearing function. METHOD Ninety-one patients (mean age, 39.5 years; mean tumor size, 18.9 mm) with preserved useful hearing immediately after surgery were retrospectively analyzed. The useful hearing was defined as the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) classes A and B. Hearing tests, including auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), were evaluated preoperatively, immediately after surgery, and at outpatient follow-up. RESULTS At the final follow-up (mean, 63.0 months), the useful hearing was maintained in 79 patients (87%), and the hearing class remained unchanged during the follow-up period in 40 patients (44%). Significant predictors of useful hearing maintenance were AAO-HNS class A immediately after surgery, improvement of ABR, and the absence of postoperative DPOAE deterioration. Postoperative DPOAE deterioration correlated with hearing class deterioration. CONCLUSIONS Despite hearing being preserved in vestibular schwannoma patients immediately after surgery, Thirteen percent lost their useful hearing during the long follow-up period, and hearing class worsened in 55% of the patients. This study, which analyzed one of the largest series of vestibular schwannoma patients, demonstrated that retrocochlear condition is a key factor for useful hearing maintenance. In patients with vestibular schwannoma who have preserved hearing function, regular postoperative monitoring of hearing function is as important as regular MRI.",2020-08-15,"Ichimasu, Norio; Kohno, Michihiro; Nakajima, Nobuyuki; Matsushima, Ken; Tanaka, Yujiro; Tsukahara, Kiyoaki; Inagaki, Taro; Yoshino, Masanori; Nagata, Osamu",Acta neurochirurgica,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-020-04523-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803370/,221129278.0

We investigated COVID-19 anxiety, general anxiety and depression symptoms, and their impact on problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity METHODS: Participants were 908 residents of a large Eastern Chinese city, surveyed from late-February to mid-March, 2020. We administered online measures including the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, and items querying COVID-19-related news exposure and threat of death. Additionally, participants rated anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 with reference to COVID-19. RESULTS: COVID-19 anxiety correlated with severity of PSU, depression and anxiety. Using established cut-off scores, 12% of participants were identified with at least moderate depression, and 24% with moderate anxiety. Using structural equation modeling, COVID-19 anxiety related to PSU severity, mediating relations between general anxiety and PSU severity. However, controlling PSU for general anxiety and depression severity, COVID-19 anxiety no longer predicted PSU severity. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include the cross-sectional research design and reliance on data from only one country.

We investigated physical and virtual sexual activities, sexual frequency and satisfaction in the 4 months following lockdown in Britain in March 2020 and compared with pre-lockdown. METHODS: Weighted analyses of web panel survey data collected July/August 2020 from a quota-based sample of 6654 people aged 18–59 years in Britain. Multivariable regression took account of participants’ opportunity for partnered sex, gender and age, to examine their independent associations with perceived changes in sexual frequency and satisfaction. RESULTS: Most participants (86.7%) reported some form of sex following lockdown with physical activities more commonly reported than virtual activities (83.7% vs 52.6%). Altogether, 63.2% reported sex with someone (‘partnered sex’) since lockdown, three-quarters of whom were in steady cohabiting relationships. With decreasing relationship formality, partnered sex was less frequently reported, while masturbation, sex toy use and virtual activities were more frequently reported. Around half of all participants perceived no change in partnered sex frequency compared with the 3 months pre-lockdown, but this was only one-third among those not cohabiting, who were more likely to report increases in non-partnered activities than those cohabiting. Two-thirds of participants perceived no change in sexual satisfaction; declines were more common among those not cohabiting. Relationship informality and younger age were independently associated with perceiving change, often declines, in sexual frequency and satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Our quasi-representative study of the British population found a substantial minority reported significant shifts in sexual repertoires, frequency and satisfaction following the introduction of COVID-19 restrictions. However, these negative changes were perceived by some more than others; predominantly those not cohabiting and the young. As these groups are most likely to experience adverse sexual health, it is important to monitor behaviour as restrictions ease to understand the longer term consequences, including for health services.",2021-12-14,"Mercer, Catherine H; Clifton, Soazig; Riddell, Julie; Tanton, Clare; Freeman, Lily; Copas, Andrew J; Dema, Emily; Bosó Pérez, Raquel; Gibbs, Jo; Macdowall, Wendy; Menezes, Dee; Ridge, Mary-Clare; Bonell, Chris; Sonnenberg, Pam; Field, Nigel; Mitchell, Kirstin R",Sex Transm Infect,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/6433baa2fbaf9c2f1e579b5a77ea664a1e3113f2.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8687784.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2021-055210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34916335/,245262409.0

In mathematics education, Geogebra has been used as a pedagogical tool in learning mathematics from elementary to university. The present study aims to explore first-year prospective elementary teachers' experience constructing 3-D shapes using GeoGebra. This study uses a case study method with 40 first-year prospective elementary teachers from an elementary initial teacher training from a public university in Riau, Indonesia. The participants worked in small groups and discussed some 3-D shapes through an online platform, and in the end, each participant reflected their attitudes towards the integration of GeoGebra in learning 3-D shapes. The findings show that prospective elementary teachers discussed six types of 3-D shapes;cube, rectangular prism, rectangular pyramid, cylinder, cone, and spheres. They prefer to discuss curved surfaces rather than flat surfaces of 3-D shapes. In addition, prospective elementary teachers have positive attitudes towards integrating GeoGebra in elementary initial teacher training. They believe that GeoGebra supports them to understand better the concepts of volume and surface area of 3-D shapes, facilitate students to understand the properties of a geometry object, and compare the object one made using hand drawing to using GeoGebra. Meanwhile, difficulty in using the tools to construct 3-D shapes in GeoGebra becomes a hinder to understand mathematics concepts and properties. The implication of this study is that there is a potential to integrate GeoGebra in mathematics learning in elementary teacher training. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.",2021,"Putra, Z.

As a potential antiviral drug target, the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 functions as a viral RNA chaperone and plays vital and multifunctional roles during the life cycle of coronavirus1-3. In this study, we discovered that the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) both in vitro and in vivo, which is further modulated by viral RNA. In addition, we found that, the core component of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2, nsp12, preferentially partitions into the N protein condensates. Moreover, we revealed that, two small molecules, i.e., CVL218 and PJ34, can be used to intervene the N protein driven phase separation and loosen the compact structures of the condensates of the N-RNA-nsp12 complex of SARS-CoV-2. The discovery of the LLPS-mediated interplay between N protein and nsp12 and the corresponding modulating compounds illuminates a feasible way to improve the accessibility of antiviral drugs (e.g., remdesivir) to their targets (e.g., nsp12/RdRp), and thus may provide useful hints for further development of effective therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2.",2020-10-09,"Zhao, Dan; Xu, Weifan; Zhang, Xiaofan; Wang, Xiaoting; Yuan, Enming; Xiong, Yuanpeng; Wu, Shenyang; Li, Shuya; Wu, Nian; Tian, Tingzhong; Feng, Xiaolong; Shu, Hantao; Lang, Peng; Shen, Xiaokun; Li, Haitao; Li, Pilong; Zeng, Jianyang",bioRxiv,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/641c64839e4f2f0fc51b81bd21f414fe9a206d77.json,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.09.332734,222799440.0

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 although mechanisms underlying AKI are yet unclear. There may be a direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 virus on the kidney; however, there is currently no data linking SARS-CoV-2 viral load (VL) to AKI. We explored the association of SARS-CoV-2 VL at admission to AKI in a large diverse cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We included patients hospitalized between March 13th and May 19th, 2020 with SARS-CoV-2 in a large academic healthcare system in New York City (N = 1,049) with available VL at admission quantified by real-time RT-PCR. We extracted clinical and outcome data from our institutional electronic health records (EHRs). AKI was defined by KDIGO guidelines. We fit a Fine-Gray competing risks model (with death as a competing risk) using demographics, comorbidities, admission severity scores, and log10 transformed VL as covariates and generated adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs). VL was associated with an increased risk of AKI (aHR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.08, p = 0.02) with a 4% increased hazard for each log10 VL change. Patients with a viral load in the top 50th percentile had an increased adjusted hazard of 1.27 (95% CI: 1.02-1.58, p = 0.03) for AKI as compared to those in the bottom 50th percentile. CONCLUSIONS: VL is weakly but significantly associated with in-hospital AKI after adjusting for confounders. This may indicate the role of VL in COVID-19 associated AKI.

In order to assess the chemical and structural changes taking place in the lubricating oil and its additives during operation it is essential to develop a method for simple and prompt analysis, which is described in this study. METHODS: Two single additives as well as a fully formulated engine oil were analysed using an atmospheric pressure matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (AP-MALDI) ion source coupled to a Linear Trap Quadrupole Orbitrap XL hybrid tandem mass spectrometer and compared with results obtained by means of electrospray ionization including additional low energy collision induced dissociation (LE-CID). The identification of additives directly from technical surfaces were simulated by using steel substrates as AP-MALDI target with varying roughness. RESULTS: After assessment and selection of the most suited AP-MALDI matrix it has been found that pure additives such as calcium sulfonate and zinc dialkyldithiophosphates (ZDDP) could well be identified with abundant signal intensity based on their elemental composition. Molecule identification was corroborated by LE-CID in electrospray ionization mode. Additionally, additives present in the fully formulated commercial oil such as ZDDP and salicylates could be reliably identified based on the elemental composition of the deprotonated molecules by means of the Orbitrap unit on different substrates including steel surfaces with high roughness. CONCLUSIONS: Atmospheric pressure matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization is an efficient technique for determination of lubricant additives directly from commercial oil blends. Identification of additive components was also achieved on steel surfaces with high roughness as applied in tribological systems and thus, it is expected that additive degradation will be possible to be assessed in real applications, enabling more effective and timely maintenance measures.",2022,"Ramopoulou, Lamprini; Widder, Lukas; Brenner, Josef; Ristic, Andjelka; Allmaier, Günter",Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom,,#mdl-35170095,,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/rcm.9271; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35170095/,246865864.0

With increasing use of proton therapy as a curative treatment for head and neck cancer, the multifaceted financial and economic implications of proton therapy—dimensions of “financial toxicity”—need to be addressed. Herein, we identify knowledge gaps and potential solutions related to the problem of financial toxicity. To date, while cost-effectiveness analysis has been used to assess the value of proton therapy for head and neck cancer, it may not fully incorporate empiric comparisons of patients' and survivors' lost productivity and disability after treatment. A cost-of-illness framework for evaluation could address this gap, thereby more comprehensively identifying the value of proton therapy and distinctly incorporating a measurable aspect of financial toxicity in evaluation. Overall, financial toxicity burdens remain understudied in head and neck cancer patients from a patient-centered perspective. Systematic, validated, and accurate measurement of financial toxicity in patients receiving proton therapy is needed, especially relative to conventional photon-based strategies. This will enrich the evidence base for optimal selection and rationale for payer coverage of available treatment options for head and neck cancer patients. In the setting of cancer care delivery, a combination of conducting proactive screening for financial toxicity in patients selected for proton therapy, initiating early financial navigation in vulnerable patients, engaging stakeholders, improving oncology provider team cost communication, expanding policies to promote price transparency, and expanding insurance coverage for proton therapy are critical practices to mitigate financial toxicity in head and neck cancer patients.",2021-06-25,"Smith, Grace L.; Shih, Ya-Chen Tina; Frank, Steven J.",Int J Part Ther,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/065024138b3e08896c7eb1a7ce028338dedbe4f5.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8270089.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34285962/; https://doi.org/10.14338/ijpt-20-00054.1,236136796.0

Initially, researchers presented adversarial attacks in the digital domain, and later the attacks were transferred to the physical domain. However, in many cases, attacks in the physical domain are conspicuous, requiring, for example, the placement of a sticker on the face, and thus may raise suspicion in real-world environments (e.g., airports).

They contain general rules that should be considered in all situations. At present, during pandemic, some waste disposal practices are under evaluation to guarantee safety conditions. For example, in view of the recent results reporting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in sewage sludge, the possibility that it diffuses in the environment is alarming. The situation may result critical in densely populated cities, which are the largest sources of sewage sludge. In this frame the diffused practice of reuse of this waste in agriculture is under revision. In this context, incineration may represent a valuable alternative strategy to manage sewage sludge during pandemic. Indeed, due to thermal treatment, the destruction of organic micropollutants and pathogens, eventually present in the waste, is guarantee. Moreover, it is fundamental to highlight that also if the management of sewage sludge changes, the ash resulting from its combustion may have suitable reuse opportunities, and their landfilling should be avoided. This work presents the available possibilities of sewage sludge ash recovery in building applications and shows the results obtained by the analysis of their sustainability. The approach is based on the use of embodied energy and carbon footprint values, to make a simple and fast new method able to be a suitable tool to support and promote sustainability also in critical situations (such as pandemic) and when all the information about a technology are not available, making not possible to perform a full-LCA approach.

The development of rapid and reliable serological tests to monitor the antibody response to coronavirus disease vaccines is necessary for post-vaccination immune responses. Therefore, in this study, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers after the first and second doses were monitored using two different measurement systems, a highly sensitive analytical platform of chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Our study included 121 participants who received two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Both methods show significant increase in anti-spike protein IgG antibody levels one week after the first vaccination, and then reached at a plateau at week five (week two after the second dose), with a 3.8 ×103-fold rise in CLEIA and a 22-fold rise in ELISA. CLEIA and ELISA showed a good correlation in the high titer range, >10 binding antibody unit (BAU)/mL. Both methods detected higher IgG antibody levels in females compared with male participants after the second vaccination, while CLEIA exhibits the sex difference after the first dose. Thus, our study showed better performance of CLEIA over ELISA in sensitivity, especially in the low concentration range, however ELISA was also useful in the high titer range (>10 BAU/mL) corresponding to the level seen several weeks after the first vaccination.",2022,"Ashenagar, Mohammad Said Matsumoto Akiko Sakai Hironori Tokiya Mikiko Hara Megumi Hirota Yoshio",Vaccines,,#covidwho-1762083,,,,,248344830.0

However, little is known regarding the impact on semen parameters and fertility potential. We sought to investigate for presence of viral RNA in semen of men with SARS-CoV-2 infection and to evaluate its effect on semen parameters in ejaculate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively recruited thirty men diagnosed with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of pharyngeal swab specimens. Semen samples were collected from each individual using mailed kits. Follow-up semen samples were done with mailed kits or in-person in office setting. Semen analysis and PCR was performed after samples were received. RESULTS: Thirty semen samples from recovered men were obtained 11-64 days after testing positive for SAR-CoV-2 infection. The median duration between positive SAR-CoV-2 test and semen collection was 37 days (interquartile range [IQR]=23). The median total sperm number (TSN) in ejaculate was 12.5 million (IQR=52.1). When compared with age-matched SARS-CoV-2(-) men, TSN was lower among SARS-CoV-2(+) men (p=0.0024). Five men completed a follow-up sperm analysis (median 3 months) and had a median TSN of 18 million (IQR=21.6). No RNA was detected by means of RT-PCR in the semen in 16 samples tested. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection, though not detected in semen of recovered men, can affect TSN in ejaculate in the acute setting.

METHODS The clinical interventional, prospective, single-centre, case series study included patients with age-related macular degeneration-related geographic atrophy (GA), in whom the eye with the worse best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) underwent a single, or repeated, intravitreal injection of EGF (0.75 µg in 50 µL). At baseline and afterwards, the eyes underwent ophthalmological examinations. RESULTS The study included seven patients (mean age:70.0±12.2 years (range: 54-86 years), with five patients receiving a single injection and two patients receiving two intravitreal injections in an interval of 4 weeks. Mean duration of follow-up was 97±97 days (median:35 days; range: 7-240 days). Mean BCVA was lower at baseline than at study end (1.41±0.44 logMAR vs 0.97±0.12 logMAR; p=0.03). Mean size of the GA lesions did not differ significantly between baseline and study end (29 212±22 887 pixels vs 29 300±22 905 pixels; p=0.59) nor did the mean perimetric mean defect (-10.3±5.9 dB vs 12.0±8.8 dB; p=0.35) or the electroretinographical b-wave amplitude (44.53±31.7 µV vs 64.5±25.5 µV; p=0.12). After a second injection 4 weeks after the first injection, one of two patients developed a cystoid macular oedema in association with an induced incomplete posterior vitreous detachment. It persisted for 3 weeks. Visual acuity in this eye improved from 1.0 logMAR at baseline to 0.80 logMAR at study end. CONCLUSIONS Except for one eye with temporary, self-resolving cystoid macular oedema, single and repeated intravitreal applications of EGF (0.75 µg) in patients with GA did not lead to intraocular inflammations or any observed intraocular side effect.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship between IFN-I levels in patients with COVID-19 and clinical presentation, SARS-CoV-2 viral load, and other major pro-inflammatory cytokines. METHODS: This prospective observational study recruited patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The levels of interferon-alpha (IFN-α), interferon-beta (IFN-β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL10) within 5 days after symptom onset were measured using an ELISA, in serum from blood collected within 5 days after the onset of symptoms. The SARS-CoV-2 viral load was determined via qPCR using nasal-swab specimens and serum. RESULTS: The study enrolled 50 patients with COVID-19. IFN-α levels were significantly higher in patients who presented with pneumonia or developed hypoxemic respiratory failure (p < 0.001). Furthermore, IFN-α levels were associated with viral load in nasal-swab specimens and RNAemia (p < 0.05). In contrast, there was no significant association between IFN-β levels and the presence of pneumonia or RNAemia, despite showing a stronger association with nasal-swab viral load (p < 0.001). Correlation analysis showed that the serum levels of IFN-α significantly correlated with those of IFN-β, IL-6, and CXCL10, while the levels of IFN-β did not correlate with those of IL-6 or CXCL10. CONCLUSIONS: Serum IFN-I levels in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection were higher in patients who developed hypoxemic respiratory failure.

AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: The significance of the vitamin D pathway in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. THERAPEUTIC INNOVATION: Vitamin D supplementation in patients after diagnosis of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: We report 4 vitamin D deficient patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in April 2020 who were provided with either cholecalciferol of 1000 IU daily (standard dose) or ergocalciferol 50,000 IU daily for 5 days (high dose) as part of supplementation. CLINICAL OUTCOMES: Patients that received a high dose of vitamin D supplementation achieved normalization of vitamin D levels and improved clinical recovery evidenced by shorter lengths of stay, lower oxygen requirements, and a reduction in inflammatory marker status.

However, securing and sustaining employment is exceptionally challenging for vulnerable populations who experience persistent and multiple barriers, such as mental illness, homelessness, food and housing insecurity, and marginalization. Evidence-based supported employment programs, most notably individual placement and support (IPS) are becoming a more common approach for addressing the needs of these high-risk individuals. The aim of this paper is to outline the protocol for evaluating an IPS program in Vancouver’s downtown and Downtown Eastside (DTES). METHODS AND DESIGN: This prospective quasi-experimental study of persons with persistent and multiple barriers to employment will use a mixed-methods approach for evaluating a novel IPS program. The evaluation will consist of survey packages and interviews that will capture outcomes related to employment and well-being, as well as the experiential process of receiving individualized and integrated supports through the IPS program. A mixed-methods approach is appropriate for this study as quantitative data will provide an objective assessment of program impacts on employment and well-being outcomes over time, while qualitative data will provide an in-depth understanding of continued barriers and experiences. DISCUSSION: The results from this evaluation will contribute evidence within a local British Columbian (BC) context that may increase access to meaningful employment for those with long-term experience of complex barriers to employment.

We have found that the reactivity of nitroxide radicals, determined by the rate of their reduction upon illumination of PS II, depends on the chemical structure of radicals and the capability of their coming close to low-potential redox centers of photoactive PS II complexes. An enhanced capability of nitroxide radicals to accept electrons from PS II correlates with their chemical structure. Nitroxide radicals NTI (2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-4-nitromethylene-3-imidazolidine-N-oxyl) and Tacet (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl-acetate), containing polar groups, appear to be most efficient acceptors of electrons donated by PS II compared to neutral (TEMPOL, 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl) or positively charged (Tamine, 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-l-oxyl) spin labels. We assume that enhanced reactivities of polar nitroxide radicals, NTI and Tacet, are determined (1) by their relatively high redox potentials, providing the possibility to accept electrons from PS II, and (2) by their affinities to the closest binding sites on the surface of PS II in the vicinity of the primary plastoquinone acceptor PQ(A) (12–14 Å) or/and in the intraprotein cavity for the secondary plastoquinone PQ(B) (~ 22 Å).",2021-09-09,"Trubitsin, B.

METHODS Based on the registration data of pediatric outpatient visits in the information system (HIS)of Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital, from January 1 2018 to December 31 2020, aged 0 to 16 years, we analyzed the changes of outpatient visits before and after the epidemic, focusing on respiratory infection including influenza. The relationship between the outpatient visits and age and quarterly distribution were also studied. RESULTS (1) Respiratory infection accounted for the majority of outpatient visits in 2018 and 2019 (60.6% and 60.5%, respectively). Non-respiratory infection accounted for the main proportion of outpatient visits in 2020, while respiratory infection accounted for only 47.4%. Annual respiratory infection visits, respiratory infectious diseases visits especially influenza visits all decreased significantly in 2020 compared with that in 2018 and 2019 (P < 0.05). (2)Respiratory infection visits were highest in the infant group, lowest in the school age group (P < 0.05) and highest in the fourth quarter each year. It decreased significantly in the second quarter of 2020 with statistical significance when compared with the other quarters of 2020(P < 0.05). (3)Influenza accounted for the highest proportion of respiratory infectious diseases visits in each year. It was highest in first quarter, which was significantly different from the other quarters of the year (P < 0.05). There were different distributions of influenza visits throughout 2018 and 2019, while it was only distributed in the first quarter and 99% in January in 2020. CONCLUSION The respiratory infection and influenza visits have decreased significantly in our pediatric outpatient department after the COVID-19 epidemic, which is considered closely related to the lifestyle and personal protection after the epidemic. It is recommended that health education on respiratory infection and influenza prevention should be strengthened, especially in winter and spring, to promote the development of good respiratory and hand hygiene habits.",2021-10-18,"Meng, H; Ji, L N; Huang, J; Chao, S; Zhou, J W; Li, X J; Yin, X M; Fan, L R",Beijing da xue xue bao.

We evaluated the impact of high- versus low-dose intravenous iron isomaltoside on the probability of retreatment with intravenous iron in iron-deficient ND-CKD patients. METHODS: This real-world, prospective, observational study collected data from 256 ND-CKD patients treated for anaemia in the UK. Following an initial course of iron isomaltoside, patients were followed for ≥12 months. Iron dose and the need for retreatment were determined at the investigators’ discretion. The primary study outcome was the need for retreatment at 52 weeks compared between patients who received >1000 mg of iron during Course 1 and those who received ≤1000 mg. Safety was evaluated through adverse drug reactions. RESULTS: The probability of retreatment at Week 52 was significantly lower in the >1000 mg iron group (n = 58) versus the ≤1000 mg group (n = 198); hazard ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]): 0.46 (0.20, 0.91); p = 0.012. Mean (95% CI) haemoglobin increased by 6.58 (4.94, 8.21) g/L in the ≤1000 mg group and by 10.59 (7.52, 13.66) g/L in the >1000 mg group (p = 0.024). Changes in other blood and iron parameters were not significantly different between the two groups. Administering >1000 mg of iron isomaltoside saved 8.6 appointments per 100 patients compared to ≤1000 mg. No serious adverse drug reactions were reported. Of the patients who received ≤1000 mg of iron in this study, 82.3% were eligible for a dose >1000 mg. CONCLUSIONS: The >1000 mg iron isomaltoside regimen reduced the probability of retreatment, achieved a greater haemoglobin response irrespective of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent treatment, and reduced the total number of appointments required, compared to the ≤1000 mg regimen. Many of the patients who received ≤1000 mg of iron were eligible for >1000 mg, indicating that there was considerable underdosing in this study.

Similarly with ATP, knockdown of TRIM30 increased caspase-1 activation and IL-1β production triggered by other NLRP3 inflammasome agonists, including nigericin, monosodium urate, and silica. Production of reactive oxygen species was increased in TRIM30 knockdown cells, and its increase was required for enhanced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, because antioxidant treatment blocked excess IL-1β production. Conversely, overexpression of TRIM30 attenuated reactive oxygen species production and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Finally, in a crystal-induced NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent peritonitis model, monosodium urate-induced neutrophil flux and IL-1β production was reduced significantly in TRIM30 transgenic mice as compared with that in their nontransgenic littermates. Taken together, our results indicate that TRIM30 is a negative regulator of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and provide insights into the role of TRIM30 in maintaining inflammatory responses.",2010,"Hu, Yu; Mao, Kairui; Zeng, Yan; Chen, Shuzhen; Tao, Zhiyun; Yang, Chen; Sun, Shuhui; Wu, Xiaodong; Meng, Guangxun; Sun, Bing",Journal of immunology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1001099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21048113/,33004822.0

We evaluated the impact of AmaTea(®) Max (referred to as AmaTea(®) throughout; a patented dietary supplement consisting of a blend of caffeine and polyphenol antioxidants), compared to both caffeine and a placebo, on gaming and cognitive performance in active gamers. METHODS: Subjects reported to the lab on three occasions, separated by approximately 1 week. On each day, they had baseline measurements taken and then played the game Fortnite for four 1-h periods. Measures of cognitive performance, gaming performance, heart rate and blood pressure (BP), and blood cortisol were measured before and at selected times following gameplay. RESULTS: Neither caffeine nor AmaTea(®) impacted gaming or cognitive performance in a statistically significant manner. However, a trend (P=0.075) was noted for the condition effect for kills/match, with values 21% higher for AmaTea(®) (1.84) compared to placebo (1.51), and 12% higher for AmaTea(®) compared to caffeine (1.63). Subjective mood was relatively unaffected, although a condition effect was noted for jittery (P=0.05), with values lower for placebo than for caffeine (P=0.02). BP was minimally elevated with both AmaTea(®) and caffeine, while cortisol followed the normal diurnal variation and was lower for placebo than AmaTea(®) and caffeine. CONCLUSION: AmaTea(®) modestly increased kills/match during gameplay. It is possible that a different gaming stimulus, varied time of gameplay, or different dosage of the supplement may have yielded different results. RELEVANCE FOR SUBJECTS: Active gamers who seek to use a dietary supplement for purposes of gaming performance may benefit slightly from ingestion of AmaTea(®) before gameplay while experiencing greater vigor and lower fatigue as compared to placebo.",2022-03-01,"Bloomer, Richard J.; Martin, Keith R.; Pence, Jacquelyn C.",J Clin Transl Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7ac2268551cfd5f78e2a1cd0125819e47a645e18.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8983391.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35392125/,247999469.0

They can be determined using respiratory variation in aortic flow peak velocity (▵Vpeak), arterial pulse pressure [▵PP and pulse pressure variation (PPV)], or plethysmographic waveform amplitude [▵POP and pleth variability index (PVI)]. These indices have not been validated in children. We studied the ability of these variables to predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated children. METHODS All results are expressed as median [median absolute deviation (MAD)]. Thirty mechanically ventilated children were studied after undergoing general anaesthesia. Mechanical ventilation was maintained with a tidal volume of 10 ml kg(-1) of body weight. ▵PP, PPV, ▵POP, PVI, ▵Vpeak, and aortic velocity-time integral were recorded before and after volume expansion (VE). Patients were considered to be responders to VE when the aortic velocity-time integral increased more than 15% after VE. RESULTS VE induced significant changes in ▵PP [13 (MAD 4) to 9 (5)%], PPV [15 (5) to 9 (5)%], ▵POP [15 (10) to 10 (6)%], PVI [13 (6) to 8 (5)%], and ▵Vpeak [16 (9) to 8 (3)%] (P<0.05 for all). Differences in ▵PP, ▵POP, PPV, and PVI did not reach statistical significance. Only ▵Vpeak was significantly different between responders (R) and non-responders (NR) to VE [22 (3) vs 7 (1)%, respectively; P<0.001]. The threshold ▵Vpeak value of 10% allowed discrimination between R and NR.

In this process, antiviral antibodies enhance the entry access of virus in the cells via interaction with the complement or Fc receptors leading to the worsening of infection. SARS-CoV-2 variants pose a general concern for the efficacy of neutralizing antibodies that may fail to neutralize infection, raising the possibility of a more severe form of COVID-19. Data from various studies on respiratory viruses raise the speculation that antibodies elicited against SARS-CoV-2 and during COVID-19 recovery could potentially exacerbate the infection through ADE at sub-neutralizing concentrations; this may contribute to disease pathogenesis. It is, therefore, of utmost importance to study the effectiveness of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19-infected subjects. Theoretically, ADE remains a general concern for the efficacy of antibodies elicited during infection, most notably in convalescent plasma therapy and in response to vaccines where it could be counterproductive.",2022-02-04,"Ajmeriya, Swati; Kumar, Amit; Karmakar, Subhradip; Rana, Shweta; Singh, Harpreet",J Indian Inst Sci,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/f0d647ea57f1594974f51c2f4ea33ec99399b792.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8814804.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35136306/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s41745-021-00268-8,246492498.0

This order belongs to a group referred to as early-diverging fungi that are characterized by high levels of N6-methyldeoxy adenine (6mA) in their genome with dense 6mA clusters associated with actively expressed genes. AlkB enzymes can act as demethylases of 6mA in DNA, with the most remarkable eukaryotic examples being mammalian ALKBH1 and Caenorhabditis elegans NMAD-1. The Mucor lusitanicus (formerly M. circinelloides f. lusitanicus) genome contains one gene, dmt1, and two genes, dmt2 and dmt3, encoding proteins similar to C. elegans NMAD-1 and ALKBH1, respectively. The function of these three genes was analyzed by the generation of single and double deletion mutants for each gene. Multiple processes were studied in the mutants, but defects were only found in single and double deletion mutants for dmt1. In contrast to the wild-type strain, dmt1 mutants showed an increase in 6mA levels during the dimorphic transition, suggesting that 6mA is associated with dimorphism in M. lusitanicus. Furthermore, the spores of dmt1 mutants challenged with macrophages underwent a reduction in polar growth, suggesting that 6mA also has a role during the spore–macrophage interaction that could be important in the infection process.",2021-09-08,"Osorio-Concepción, Macario; Lax, Carlos; Navarro, Eusebio; Nicolás, Francisco E.; Garre, Victoriano",J Fungi (Basel),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/f20a16a143b4b307b52689e3f1ea6fb6ceba6681.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8470550.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34575776/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jof7090738,237934859.0

However, the performance of RADT in vaccinated individuals has not been fully investigated. Objectives RT-qPCR and rapid antigen detection testing were performed to evaluate the performance of the Standard Q COVID-19 Ag Test in detecting SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals. Study design Two swab specimens, one for RT-qPCR and one for RADT, were collected from vaccinated individuals in an outpatient clinic. For comparison of RADT performance in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, a dataset already published by this group was used as reference. Results A total of 696 samples were tested with both RT-qPCR and RADT that included 692 (99.4%) samples from vaccinated individuals. Of these, 76 (11.0%) samples were detected SARS-CoV-2 positive by RT-qPCR and 45 (6.5%) samples by the Standard Q COVID-19 Ag test. Stratified by Ct values, sensitivity of the RADT was 100.0%, 94.4% and 81.1% for Ct ≤ 20 (n=18), Ct ≤ 25 (n=36) and Ct ≤ 30 (n=53), respectively. Samples with Ct values ≥ 30 (n=23) were not detected. Overall RADT specificity was 99.7% and symptom status did not affect RADT performance.

Online practitioners are eager to learn how to adapt to online delivery, although platform-specific training is limited. The aim of the current study was to focus upon the therapist experience of online therapeutic relationships with young people, exploring a range of factors through their perspectives, including the impact of anonymity. Methods: Eight e-therapy practitioners were recruited from Kooth, an online mental health service. Narrative interviews undertaken via Skype facilitated reflective conversational one-to-one discussions, based upon the practitioners’ individual experiences, led by the interviewee. Following transcription and anonymisation, a narrative analysis was undertaken to explore participants’ experiences, perspectives and reflections. Results: Four analytic layers arose from the narratives, which explored the challenging learning experience of translating existing therapeutic skills to online working, rapidly building therapeutic relationships, managing risk in the online therapeutic relationship, and techniques for maintaining a digital therapeutic relationship.

Researchers, however, continue to experience delays in access, storage and sharing of administrative data. Training opportunities are limited and typically specific to individual data providers or focussed on the analytical aspects of working with administrative data. The CENTRIC study was funded by the Information Commissioners Office, with the aim of developing a broader training curriculum for researchers working with administrative data in the UK. METHODS: A mixed-methods design informed curriculum content, including surveys with researchers, focus group discussions with data providers and workshops with members of the public. Researchers were identified from relevant administrative data networks and invited to participate in an online survey identifying training needs. Data providers were approached with a request to input to a face-to-face or online meeting with two members of the research team about their experiences of working with researchers. Data were analysed within the broad framework of the interview schedule, free text responses in the survey were analysed thematically. RESULTS: 107 researchers responded to the online survey and four data providers participated in the focus groups. We identified five main themes, relating to research training needs for UK researchers working with administrative data: communication; timelines; changes & amendments; future-proofing applications; and, the availability of training and support. Data providers either provided additional evidence on these learning needs or ways to address identified challenges. Six modules were developed addressing these training needs.

Through this case study, we found that instructors cited increased workload and lack of connection as challenges with remote teaching, in addition to pandemic-related struggles. Most instructors reported using either synchronous or a mix of synchronous and asynchronous instruction in course design, incorporating both formative and summative assessments, and implementing communication and community-building strategies to establish connections with and among students.

In this single-center cohort study, comprising 300 participants, two phone interviews were conducted (2-week and 1-month after hospitalization) and symptoms were queried with a standardized form. This form included musculoskeletal symptoms and other COVID-19 symptoms. Considering all symptoms (musculoskeletal and other), 100.0%, 86.7%, and 72.0% of patients reported one or more symptoms, at hospitalization, 2-week, and 1-month, respectively. Considering only musculoskeletal symptoms, 92.3%, 72.7%, and 56.3% of patients reported any musculoskeletal symptom at hospitalization, 2-week, and 1-month, respectively. The musculoskeletal symptoms were fatigue (44.3% of patients reported), back pain (22.7%), arthralgia (22.0%), myalgia (21.0%), low back pain (16.3%), and neck pain (10.3%); the other symptoms were shortness of breath (26.3%), loss of taste (15.0%), cough (14.0%), loss of smell (12.3%), loss of appetite (10.3%), headache (8.7%), sore throat (3.0%), diarrhea (1.3%), dizziness (1.3%), and fever (0.3%) at 1-month. Increasing BMI was associated with higher odds of persistence of fatigue (OR: 1.08, 1.03 to 1.13), myalgia (OR: 1.08, 1.01 to 1.14), and arthralgia (OR: 1.07, 1.02 to 1.14, p = 0.012) at 1-month. Nearly three-quarters reported one or more symptoms, with more than half of patients reported any musculoskeletal symptom at 1 month. The most common musculoskeletal symptom was fatigue, followed by back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, low back pain, and neck pain. The persistence of fatigue, myalgia, and arthralgia was related to BMI.

This protein is primarily regulated by the androgen receptor, and this mechanism may partly explain the disproportionate burden of disease among males. We hypothesized that the use of androgen modulation therapies (AMT) such as 5-a-reductase inhibitors (5-ARI) and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may affect inpatient outcomes among hospitalized men with COVID-19. METHODS: In a single-center retrospective analysis in a large urban hospital system, hospitalized males with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and/or prostate cancer was identified from February to June 2020. Men were then stratified by use of specific AMT (ADT or 5- ARI). Baseline patient and hospital characteristics were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and multivariable regression models were used to explore the association of AMT with inpatient mortality, length of hospital stay (LOS), and other ICU outcomes (ICU admission, ICU Length of Stay, Non-Invasive Mechanical Ventilation, Intubation, and ARDS). RESULTS: A total of 396 inpatients were identified, with 130 (32.8%) having prior use of AMT. Of these, a large majority used 5-ARI (n=122, 93.8%). Mean (SD) age of patients was higher for those using AMT (76.5 (10.7) vs. 71.1 (11.8) years;p<0.001). No significant differences were identified in AMT use by race, body mass index, smoking status, or Charlson Comorbidity Index. Despite adjustment for these factors, AMT use was not associated with ICU admission, ventilation status, length of ICU stay, or length of hospital stay. However, a non-significant trend of decreased mortality was identified with the use of AMT (adjusted OR: 0.56;95% CI: 0.29e1.02;p=0.06) (Table 1). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary analysis suggests that AMT does not appear to improve inpatient outcomes among hospitalized males with COVID-19. The non-significant trend of decreased inpatient mortality, however, may be attributed to insufficient power. Future research with large sample sizes may uncover potential benefits of androgen modulation on COVID19 pathogenesis and outcomes.",2021,"Ha, A.; Punjani, N.; Wang, V.; Caputo, J.; Wallace, B.

This study explores a specific phenotype of COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation (COV-HI), and its associations with escalation of respiratory support and survival. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled consecutive inpatients (aged ≥18 years) admitted to University College London Hospitals and Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals in the UK with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 during the first wave of community-acquired infection. Demographic data, laboratory tests, and clinical status were recorded from the day of admission until death or discharge, with a minimum follow-up time of 28 days. We defined COV-HI as a C-reactive protein concentration greater than 150 mg/L or doubling within 24 h from greater than 50 mg/L, or a ferritin concentration greater than 1500 μg/L. Respiratory support was categorised as oxygen only, non-invasive ventilation, and intubation. Initial and repeated measures of hyperinflammation were evaluated in relation to the next-day risk of death or need for escalation of respiratory support (as a combined endpoint), using a multi-level logistic regression model. FINDINGS: We included 269 patients admitted to one of the study hospitals between March 1 and March 31, 2020, among whom 178 (66%) were eligible for escalation of respiratory support and 91 (34%) patients were not eligible. Of the whole cohort, 90 (33%) patients met the COV-HI criteria at admission. Despite having a younger median age and lower median Charlson Comorbidity Index scores, a higher proportion of patients with COV-HI on admission died during follow-up (36 [40%] of 90 patients) compared with the patients without COV-HI on admission (46 [26%] of 179). Among the 178 patients who were eligible for full respiratory support, 65 (37%) met the definition for COV-HI at admission, and 67 (74%) of the 90 patients whose respiratory care was escalated met the criteria by the day of escalation. Meeting the COV-HI criteria was significantly associated with the risk of next-day escalation of respiratory support or death (hazard ratio 2·24 [95% CI 1·62–2·87]) after adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidity. INTERPRETATION: Associations between elevated inflammatory markers, escalation of respiratory support, and survival in people with COVID-19 indicate the existence of a high-risk inflammatory phenotype. COV-HI might be useful to stratify patient groups in trial design.

Little data is available about contingency protocols to minimize the spread of the virus in these centers. The goal of this study was to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 and the preventive and management measures adopted at the National Hospital for Paraplegics (Toledo, Castilla-La Mancha, Spain) to minimize the risk of transmission of Covid-19. METHODS A team of specialists in Preventive and Internal Medicine established a protocol for active surveillance, identification of suspected and confirmed cases, and follow-up of contacts. Also, a Unit for the care of confirmed cases was created with personnel specifically trained in Covid-19, to achieve better patient care and optimize the available resources. Descriptive statistical measures have been used to analyze the data. RESULTS The prevalence of Covid-19 was 12.2%, with a cumulative incidence of 8.2%. After the protocol was established, control of the disease was achieved without hospital transmission after its application. Due to the alarm generated at the start of the pandemic, up to 45% of the requested RT-PCRs did not meet the criteria of the Ministry of Health, all of which were negative. The clinical characteristics of our patients differed slightly from those observed in other studies published in the general population, with cough and asthenia being the most frequent symptoms, present in 69.2% and 38.5%, respectively. 100% of the infected patients did not present complications that required assistance in the Intensive Care Unit. CONCLUSIONS With the application of preventive and organizational actions, we consider that we have presented a low incidence of those infected. The preparation of protocols and their supervision is essential for the rapid identification of cases and optimization of the tests requested. Despite being a medium and long-stay hospital, we have not presented any mortality or complications that required admission to the Intensive Care Unit.",2020-07-13,"Ruiz Moruno, Antonio José; Rodríguez Cola, Miguel; Jiménez Velasco, Irena; Ruíz Delgado, Rosa María; González Rubio, Alicia",Revista espanola de salud publica,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32655128/,220500985.0

METHODS: This was a retrospective observational analysis of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to hospital or managed in the community and their household contacts across a London population during the period March 1st to April 1st, 2020. Symptomatology and duration were extracted from routinely collected clinical data and follow-up telephone consultations. Descriptive statistics were used. RESULTS: Of 386 patients, 141 (92 community patients, 49 discharged inpatients) were included for analysis; 77/141 (55%) reported anosmia and ageusia, nine reported only ageusia and three only anosmia. The median onset of anosmia in relation to onset of SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) symptoms (as defined by the Public Health England case definition) was 4 days (interquartile range (IQR) 5). Median duration of anosmia was 8 days (IQR 16). Median duration of COVID-19 symptoms in community patients was 10 days (IQR 8) versus 18 days (IQR 13.5) in admitted patients. As of April 1, 45 patients had ongoing COVID-19 symptoms and/or anosmia; 107/141 (76%) patients had household contacts, and of 185 non-tested household contacts 79 (43%) had COVID-19 symptoms with 46/79 (58%) reporting anosmia. Six household contacts had anosmia only. CONCLUSIONS: Over half of the positive patients reported anosmia and ageusia, suggesting that these should be added to the case definition and used to guide self-isolation protocols.

z8p5ud7x,,WHO,Face masks in the general healthy population. Scientific and ethical issues,,,,unk,"In most European countries, facemasks use is recommended or mandatory in enclosed spaces where physical distancing is not possible. In Spain, this measure was first extended to open public spaces and later made mandatory regardless of whether or not the interpersonal safety distance can be kept. At present, there is no evidence on the effectiveness of universal masking of healthy people in the community to prevent infection with respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The mandatory use of masks poses some ethical questions. Firstly, it entails a paternalistic action. Secondly, application of the principle of precaution becomes questionable when there is no clear benefit-risk relationship. Thirdly, compulsoriness can interfere with equity of public health actions. Fourthly, it can result in social stigma and discrimination against those who do not wear one, even though they well may have good reasons for doing so. Lastly, this measure may generate confusion in the population, along with an altered perception of the risk. The World Health Organization recommends its use in public places with a high potential risk of transmission and where other prevention measures, such as physical distancing, are not possible. Mandatory use of masks in public open spaces, regardless of the risk of transmission or of whether or not the interpersonal safety distance can be kept, is an intrusive measure that restricts individual freedoms, and would not appear to be justified on the basis of available scientific evidence.

It demonstrates the racist and xenophobic impact of drug control policy and proposes a path to move beyond oppressive systems and structures. The ‘colonization of drug control’ refers to the use of drug control by states in Europe and America to advance and sustain the systematic exploitation of people, land and resources and the racialized hierarchies, which were established under colonial control and continue to dominate today. Globally, Black, Brown and Indigenous peoples are disproportionately targeted for drug law enforcement and face discrimination across the criminal system. These communities face higher arrest, prosecution and incarceration rates for drug offenses than other communities, such as majority populations, despite similar rates of drug use and selling among (and between) different races. Current drug policies have contributed to an increase in drug-related deaths, overdoses and sustained transnational criminal enterprises at the expense of the lives of people who use drugs, their families and greater society. This review provides further evidence of the need to reform the current system. It outlines a three-pillared approach to rebuilding drug policy in a way that supports health, dignity and human rights, consisting of: (1) the decriminalization of drugs and their use; (2) an end to the mass incarceration of people who use drugs; (3) the redirection of funding away from ineffective and punitive drug control and toward health and social programs.",2021-11-27,"Daniels, Colleen; Aluso, Aggrey; Burke-Shyne, Naomi; Koram, Kojo; Rajagopalan, Suchitra; Robinson, Imani; Shelly, Shaun; Shirley-Beavan, Sam; Tandon, Tripti",Harm Reduct J,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/2dec0414523a01347c8620baf5d416ef406451a6.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8626718.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8626718/,

In this research paper, we aimed to study the perceptions of women in Jordan during the pandemic regarding fertility behavior, the desire to use assisted reproductive technology (ART) and the awareness and beliefs of potential risks related to conception. Methods: A validated online-based questionnaire was distributed to women from April–May 2020, Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical software SPSS version 22 and R software (2020); p values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: The total number of participants was 814 women, with 78.2% of the participants (58.7% fertile and 76.6% infertile) believing that pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic could be risky. Among them, 16% and 40%, respectively, were trying to conceive during the pandemic, and 97.4% and 89.9%, respectively, were not willing to use ART if needed during the pandemic. Young, nulliparous women who were married for less than one year were significantly associated with the desire to conceive during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: This study concluded that the fertility behavior of women in Jordan changed during the pandemic, and their desire for natural conception and for using ART declined, as they believed that there were potential risks related to conceiving during the pandemic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized crossover clinical trial, thirty-five children with moderate to severe anxiety requiring bilateral pulp therapy of mandibular primary molars were enrolled. Based on random lists, 18 children received the BE + IANB and 17 children received a routine IANB at the first session. This trend became reverse at the second visit for each child. Anxiety was measured using Facial Image Scale (FIS), blood pressure, and pulse rate. Face Leg Activity Cry Consolability (FLACC) scale and Wong–Baker Facial Pain Scale (WBFPS) were used for pain measurement. The Paired Samples Test, Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, and Interclass Correlation Coefficient were used for data analysis. RESULTS: The means of FLACC, WBFPS, FIS, blood pressure, and pulse rate were higher at the control visit. However, these differences were statistically significant only for FLACC scale and WBFPS (P value <0.05). In subgroup analysis, only girls and children without any previous dental treatment showed significant differences in FLACC scale and WBFPS between the control and bubble blower side (P value <0.05). CONCLUSION: Breathing exercise using a bubble blower may be an efficient distraction and relaxation method to decrease pain of 7- to 10-year-old children with moderate to severe anxiety during inferior alveolar nerve block.

However, the theoretical underpinnings of the most widely used, coalescent methods have been questioned, casting doubt on their interpretation. The aim of this study is to develop robust population genetic inference for compartmental models in epidemiology. Using a general approach based on the theory of metapopulations, we derive coalescent models under susceptible–infectious (SI), susceptible–infectious–susceptible (SIS) and susceptible–infectious–recovered (SIR) dynamics. We show that exponential and logistic growth models are equivalent to SI and SIS models, respectively, when co-infection is negligible. Implementing SI, SIS and SIR models in BEAST, we conduct a meta-analysis of hepatitis C epidemics, and show that we can directly estimate the basic reproductive number (R(0)) and prevalence under SIR dynamics. We find that differences in genetic diversity between epidemics can be explained by differences in underlying epidemiology (age of the epidemic and local population density) and viral subtype. Model comparison reveals SIR dynamics in three globally restricted epidemics, but most are better fit by the simpler SI dynamics.

This is widely criticised as a hastily taken step with political inclination and minimal evidence backing. In the current scenario, where there is mass fear against COVID‐19, this recommendation has made the people to believe that it will kill the viruses. This has important public health implications which are discussed below. Better communication should have been planned to ensure everyone does not go out and buy it. However, as a nation of 1.3 billion, we need to capitalize on this opportunity to generate data and valuable evidence on the use of HCQ to beat this pandemic. All health care workers taking this drug should volunteer themselves to be part of a trial/observational study and get registered online to generate useful data related to its safety and efficacy and guide future recommendations. The other risk group which includes asymptomatic contacts of laboratory confirmed COVID‐19 patients are under surveillance by the state and local health authorities and could also be roped into this study to generate robust evidence.

The aim of this study is to explore workers’ perspectives of teleworking in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic regarding the effects on their well-being and social participation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Using a participatory study protocol involving the collaboration of a community organisation defending workers’ rights, the first step will be to conduct focus groups to qualitatively describe workers’ perspectives of their teleworking conditions. Then, an online questionnaire will be administered to a large pool or workers to quantitatively explore the influence of individual, organisational and environmental variables on the well-being and social participation of workers. The thematic and statistical analyses of the data collected will indicate successful practices to be adopted by workers and organisations. These successful practices will be validated by workers through a Technique for Research of Information by Animation of a Group of Experts group and will serve as concrete tools to better support workers’ participation in teleworking.

A global supply chain network that considers disruptions is needed. This study strategically analyzes the economic and structural effects of disruption on a global supply chain network with customs duty and the trans-pacific partnership (TPP) agreement. Methods: We present a cost minimization model which helps in understanding the difficulty of supplying materials or products to factories or customers if the supplier’s cities are facing disruption. This enables us to model and evaluate simultaneous considerations of supplier disruption, customs duty, and TPP in redesigning a global supply chain network. This network is modeled and formulated using integer programming, disruption scenarios, and a sensitivity analysis for customs duty. Results: Regarding the impact of disruptions on suppliers, two patterns emerge in the reconfigured network: direct changes due to supplier disruptions and indirect changes due to factory relocation.

Infection with Zika virus (ZIKV) during pregnancy can cause devastating fetal outcomes, and efforts to understand natural immunity to this infection are essential for optimizing vaccine design. In this study, we leveraged the high-dimensional single-cell profiling capacity of mass cytometry (CyTOF) to deeply characterize the cellular immune response to acute and convalescent ZIKV infection in a cohort of blood donors in Puerto Rico incidentally found to be viremic during the 2015-2016 epidemic in the Americas. During acute ZIKV infection, we identified widely coordinated responses across innate and adaptive immune cell lineages. High frequencies of multiple activated innate immune subsets, as well as activated follicular helper CD4+ T cells and proliferating CD27-IgD-B cells, during acute infection were associated with high titers of ZIKV neutralizing antibodies at 6 months post-infection. On the other hand, low titers of ZIKV neutralizing antibodies were associated with immune features that suggested a cytotoxic-skewed immune “set-point.” Our study offers insight into the cellular coordination of immune responses and identifies candidate cellular biomarkers that may offer predictive value in vaccine efficacy trials for ZIKV and other acute viral infections aimed at inducing high titers of neutralizing antibodies.

While measures to improve air quality in megacities such as Delhi are typically aimed at reducing levels of particulate matter (PM), ozone could become a greater threat if these measures focus on PM alone, as some air pollution mitigation steps can actually lead to an increase in surface ozone. A better understanding of the factors controlling ozone production in Delhi and the impact that PM mitigation measures have on ozone is therefore critical for improving air quality. Here, we combine in situ observations and model analysis to investigate the impact of PM reduction on the non-linear relationship between volatile organic compounds (VOC), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ozone. In situ measurements of NOx, VOC, and ozone were conducted in Delhi during the APHH-India programme in summer (June) and winter (November) 2018. We observed hourly averaged ozone concentrations in the city of up to 100 ppbv in both seasons. We performed sensitivity simulations with a chemical box model to explore the impacts of PM on the non-linear VOC-NOx-ozone relationship in each season through its effect on aerosol optical depth (AOD). We find that ozone production is limited by VOC in both seasons, and is particularly sensitive to solar radiation in winter. Reducing NOx alone increases ozone, such that a 50% reduction in NOx emissions leads to 10-50% increase in surface ozone. In contrast, reducing VOC emissions can reduce ozone efficiently, such that a 50% reduction in VOC emissions leads to ∼60% reduction in ozone. Reducing PM alone also increases ozone, especially in winter, by reducing its dimming effects on photolysis, such that a 50% reduction in AOD can increase ozone by 25% and it also enhances VOC-limitation. Our results highlight the importance of reducing VOC emissions alongside PM to limit ozone pollution, as well as benefitting control of PM pollution through reducing secondary organic aerosol. This will greatly benefit the health of citizens and the local ecosystem in Delhi, and could have broader application for other megacities characterized by severe PM pollution and VOC-limited ozone production.",2020-11-27,"Chen, Ying; Beig, Gufran; Archer-Nicholls, Scott; Drysdale, Will; Acton, W Joe F; Lowe, Douglas; Nelson, Beth; Lee, James; Ran, Liang; Wang, Yu; Wu, Zhijun; Sahu, Saroj Kumar; Sokhi, Ranjeet S; Singh, Vikas; Gadi, Ranu; Nicholas Hewitt, C; Nemitz, Eiko; Archibald, Alex; McFiggans, Gordon; Wild, Oliver",Faraday discussions,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0fd00079e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33244555/,225370700.0

BACKGROUND: Since an outbreak of COVID‐19 was first reported in China in December 2019, it has profoundly changed the lives of families and children of all ages. In particular, it has created challenges among families with college‐age young adult children. METHOD: Using a sample of 484 college students from 21 universities in China, an online survey design was utilized to obtain information from these students on their family demographics and economic situation, parent–child interactions, and individual well‐being during COVID‐19. RESULTS: Results from structural equation modeling suggested that family income loss due to COVID‐19 was related to economic pressure. Economic pressure was associated with negative interactions between parents and young adult children, which were associated with problems in young adult children's mental health (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms). Further, self‐control was found to buffer the association between family income loss and economic pressure, and respect for family was found to weaken the association between economic pressure and negative parent–child interactions. CONCLUSION: Findings supported the hypotheses of the negative impacts of COVID‐19 on young adult children's mental health and the resilience factors that buffered the negative impacts.

This study investigated the opioid-sparing effectsof the oblique subcostal transversus abdominis plane (OSTAP) blockade with ropivacaine for the patients undergoing open liver resection with a Mercedes incision. METHODS 126 patients who were scheduled for open liver resection were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive bilateral ultrasound-guided OSTAPblocks with either 0.375% ropivacaine (groupT) or 0.9% isotonic saline (group C). Both groups also received intravenous patient-controlled analgesia and intravenous 40 mg parecoxib every 12 h for a total of 3 days. Preoperative and intraoperative parameters, plus intraoperative and postoperative cumulative sufentanil consumption, were recorded. RESULTS 70 patients were enrolled in the study finally. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to preoperative parameters, and surgical and anesthetic characteristics. The intraoperative sufentanil use, cumulative sufentanil consumption at 5 min after extubation, 2 h, 4 h,12 h and 24 h after operation in group T was significantly less than that in group C (P = 0.001, 0.001, 0.000, 0.000, 0.001 and 0.044, respectively). Compared with group C, postoperative NRS pain scores at rest were significantly lower at 2 h and 4 h postoperatively in group T (P = 0.04and 0.02, respectively); NRS scores at the time of coughing were also significantly lower in group T than in group C at all time points except 5 min after extubation (all P < 0.001). Furthermore, compared with group C, the number of intraoperative vasodilator use, the extubation time and the incidence of nausea was reduced in group T. CONCLUSION Ultrasound-guided OSTAP block with ropivacaine can significantly decrease the perioperative cumulative dosage of analgesics and improve analgesic effect without obvious side effects for the patients who underwent an open liver resection with Mercedes incision when compared tothe ultrasound-guided OSTAP block with saline.

OBJECTIVES/GOALS: o Provide students with a meaningful and safe research experience during the COVID Pandemic. o Develop new modules and approaches that could be delivered virtually. o Engage students from communities that were not possible in previous years when in person meetings were required. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: o The program has historically supported over 100 high school students per year in a summer research internship for the last 5 years. Students are placed with academic research mentors in various Schools and Departments across the IUPUI campus, and also with industry laboratories. o COVID-related restrictions required development of 100% virtual program. Key aspects of the virtual program included: cohort-based research mentor assignments with 1-4 mentees matched per research mentor, research projects that could be conducted virtually, heavy engagement of high-school teachers to facilitate the research experience with cohorts of mentees, a more rigorous virtual seminar series that included new modules such as COVID-specific programming and thus enhancing public education about COVID. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: o The program served 130 students in summer 2020. o We were able to recruit new faculty and industry mentors involved in data science research. As a result, we have now increased our mentor pool to serve more students in the future. o Because student participation was virtual, we were able to accept students from further distances (up to 120 miles away) across the state. We were also able to accept local economically disadvantaged students that may have not been able to participate because of lack of reliable transportation. o A positive unanticipated outcome was that mentees relationships with the mentors was established virtually thus increasing the potential for students to remain engaged in their research. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: o Adapting to a virtual platform provided research experience to high school students during a time when traditional approaches were not possible.

Our study investigated alterations in the plasma metabolic profiles by comparing PLWH on long-term cART(>5 years) and matched HIV-negative controls (HC) in two cohorts from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), Cameroon, and India, respectively, to understand the system-level dysregulation in HIV-infection. Using untargeted and targeted LC-MS/MS-based metabolic profiling and applying advanced system biology methods, an altered amino acid metabolism, more specifically to glutaminolysis in PLWH than HC were reported. A significantly lower level of neurosteroids was observed in both cohorts and could potentiate neurological impairments in PLWH.

Notably, SARS‐CoV‐2 is equipped with a second, polybasic cleavage site for the ubiquitous furin protease, which may determine the widespread tissue tropism. Furthermore, the terminal sequence of the furin‐cleaved spike protein also binds to neuropilin receptors. Clinically, there is enormous variability in the severity of the disease. Severe consequences are seen in a relatively small number of patients, most show moderate symptoms, but asymptomatic cases, especially among young people, drive disease spread.

MATERIAL AND METHODS In the phantom experiment, seven robot-assisted punctures were made to evaluate the accuracy of the method. In the animal experiment, 18 punctures (nine robotic and nine manual) were made in the livers of nine rabbits. The indicators, such as needle-tract length, angle deviation, puncture accuracy, number of scans required, and radiation exposure dose were compared between manual and robotic punctures. The paired-samples t-test was used for analysis. RESULTS In the phantom experiment, the mean accuracy of seven punctures was 2.67 mm. In the animal experiment, there was no significant difference in needle-tract length (32.58 mm vs. 34.04 mm, p = .606), angle deviation (17.21° vs. 21.23° p = .557) and puncture accuracy (8.42 vs. 8.77 mm, p = .851) between the two groups.

A shorter hospital length of stay (LOS) has been implicated as premature discharge, that may in turn lead to adverse consequences. We tested the hypothesis that a short LOS might be associated with increased risk of readmissions within 28 days of hospital discharge and also post-discharge mortality. METHODS: We conducted a single-centred study of 32 270 (46.1% men) consecutive alive-discharge episodes (mean age = 64.0 years, standard deviation = 20.5, range = 18–107 years), collected between 01/04/2017 and 31/03/2019. Associations of LOS tertiles (middle tertile as a reference) with readmissions and mortality were assessed using observed/expected ratios, and logistic and Cox regressions to estimate odds (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) (adjusted for age, sex, patients’ severity of underlying health status and index admissions), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The observed numbers of readmissions within 28 days of hospital discharge or post-discharge mortality were lower than expected (observed: expected ratio < 1) in patients in the bottom tertile (<1.2 days) and middle tertile (1.2–4.3 days) of LOS, whilst higher than expected (observed: expected ratio > 1) in patients in the top tertile (>4.3 days), amongst all ages. Patients in the top tertile of LOS had increased risks for one readmission: OR = 2.32 (95% CI = 1.86–2.88) or ≥2 readmissions: OR = 6.17 (95% CI = 5.11–7.45), death within 30 days: OR = 2.87 (95% CI = 2.34–3.51), and within six months of discharge: OR = 2.52 (95% CI = 2.23–2.85), and death over a two-year period: HR = 2.25 (95% CI = 2.05–2.47). The LOS explained 7.4% and 15.9% of the total variance (r(2)) in one readmission and ≥2 readmissions, and 9.1% and 10.0% of the total variance in mortality with 30 days and within six months of hospital discharge, respectively. Within the bottom, middle and top tertiles of the initial LOS, the median duration from hospital discharge to death progressively shortened from 136, 126 to 80 days, whilst LOS during readmission lengthened from 0.4, 0.9 to 2.8 days, respectively. CONCLUSION: Short LOS in hospital was associated with favourable post-discharge outcomes such as early readmission and mortality, and with a delay in time interval from discharge to death and shorter LOS in hospital during readmission.

Evidence regarding COVID-19 middle- and long-term consequences on endothelium are still lacking. Our study aimed to evaluate if COVID-19 severity could significantly affect the endothelial function after three months from the acute phase. Methods: We assessed endothelial function in outpatients with previous COVID-19 three months after negative SARS-CoV-2 molecular test by measuring flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in patients categorized according to a four-variable COVID-19 severity scale ('home care';;'hospital, no oxygen';;'hospital, oxygen';;'hospital requiring high-flow nasal canula, non-invasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation';). FMD difference among COVID-19 severity categories was assessed with analysis of variance;we further clarified the relationship between FMD and previous COVID-19 severity with multivariate logistic models. Results: Among 658 consecutive COVID-19 subjects, we observed a significant linear trend of FMD reduction with the increase of the COVID-19 category (p < 0.0001). The presence of endothelial dysfunction was more frequent among hospitalized patients (78.3%) with respect to home-care patients (21.7%;p < 0.0001).

Herein, we calculated molecular dynamics simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein of Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (wild type, WT) and the Omicron variant of concern. Structural analyses reveal that the SpikeOmicron presents more conformational flexibility than SpikeWT, mainly in the N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD). Such flexibility results in a broader spectrum of different conformations for SpikeOmicron, whereby the RBD can more easily visit an up-conformational state. We reported how the mutations in this variant may influence the intra- and inter-protomer contacts caused by conformational flexibility. Based on our analysis, we suggest that the differences in conformational flexibility between SpikeOmicron and SpikeWT may explain the observed gains in infectivity, immune system evasion and transmissibility in this novel variant.

The goals of this review were to characterize the demographics, presentation, clinical management, and outcomes, and to evaluate how time to intervention associates with outcomes in trauma patients with upper extremity vascular injuries. METHODS: The National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) Research Data Set for the years 2007-2016 was queried in order to identify adult patients (age ≥ 18) with an upper extremity arterial injury. Patients with brachiocephalic, subclavian, axillary, or brachial artery injury using the 1998 and 2005 versions of the Abbreviated Injury Scale were included. Patients with non-survivable injuries to the brain, traumatic amputation, or other major arterial injuries to the torso or lower extremities were excluded. RESULTS: The data from 7908 patients with upper extremity arterial injuries was reviewed. Of those, 5407 (68.4%) underwent repair of the injured artery. The median Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 10 (IQR = 7-18), and 7.7% of patients had a severe ISS (≥ 25). Median time to repair was 120 min (IQR = 60-240 min). Management was open repair in 52.3%, endovascular repair in 7.3%, and combined open and endovascular repairs in 8.8%; amputation occurred in 1.8% and non-operative management was used in 31.6% of patients. Blunt mechanism of injury, crush injury, concomitant fractures/dislocations, and nerve injuries were associated with amputation, whereas simultaneous venous injury was not. There was a significant decrease in the rate of amputation when patients undergoing surgical revascularization did so within 90 min of injury (P = 0.007).

The prominent applications include decision-making, pattern recognition, clustering analysis, medical diagnosis, etc. In this paper, we introduce a new correlation coefficient for picture fuzzy sets with the justification of its advantages. This correlation coefficient is better than the existing correlation coefficients and other such measures in the picture fuzzy theory because it considers the picture fuzzy set as a whole and also expresses the nature (positive or negative) as well as the extent of association between two PFSs. By performing some comparative analysis based on the computation of correlation degree and linguistic hedges, we establish the effectiveness of the suggested correlation measure over some available correlation measures in a picture fuzzy environment.

MethodsThe meteorological parameters chosen were Temperature, Dew Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, Wind Speed. The underlying basic relationships between meteorological parameters and COVID-19 information for Mumbai was understood using Spearmans rank correlation coefficients. After establishing basic relationships, Linear analysis and Generalized Additive Models (GAM) were used to figure out statistically significant weather parameters and model them to explain the best possible variance in the pandemic data. ResultsA model of temperature and windspeed could explain 17.3% and 8.3% of variance in Daily new cases and Daily recoveries respectively. As for deaths occurring due to the virus, a model comprising of only pressure best explains a variance of 17.3% in the data. Non-Linear modelling based on GAM confirms the findings of linear analysis and establishes certain non-linear relationships as well. ConclusionSARS-CoV-2 belongs to the class of Human Coronaviruses (HCoV) which show seasonality depending on weather conditions. The above article focuses on understanding the underlying relationships between SARS-CoV-2 and meteorological parameters that would help progress basic research and formulation of policies around the disease for each weather/season.

These networks reveal how social distancing measures and the public's reaction to the incipient pandemic affected the connectivity patterns within the city. We find that as the pandemic developed there was a substantial decrease in the number of individuals with many contacts. We further study the impact of these different network topologies on the spread of COVID-19 by simulating an SEIR epidemic model over these networks, and find that the reduced connectivity greatly suppressed the epidemic. We then investigate how the epidemic responds when part of the population is vaccinated, and we compare two vaccination distribution strategies, both with and without social distancing. Our main result is that the heavy-tailed degree distribution of the contact networks causes a targeted vaccination strategy that prioritizes high-contact individuals to reduce the number of cases far more effectively than a strategy that vaccinates individuals at random. Combining both targeted vaccination and social distancing leads to the greatest reduction in cases, and we also find that the marginal benefit of a targeted strategy as compared to a random strategy exceeds the marginal benefit of social distancing for reducing the number of cases.

Aims: This study explored influences on student wellbeing throughout the first wave of the corona crisis in the Netherlands by testing serial mediation models of the relationships between perceived academic stress, depression, resilience, and HE support. Methods: The Covid-19 International Student Wellbeing Study (C19 ISWS) was used, with a total sample of 2,480 higher education students studying at InHolland Universities of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands. Student subgroups were created, so that students with low and high perceived academic stress could be assessed, in addition to depressed and non-depressed students. Predictive model fit was tested using Macro PROCESS. Results: A significant serial mediation model for the total student sample was revealed, including protective mediating effects of resilience and HE support on the positive direct effect of perceived academic stress on depression. At subgroup level, significant (partial) predictive effects of resilience on depression scores were noted. A partial serial effect between resilience and HE support was found for students with low perceived stress levels, whereas a parallel partial mediation model was present among highly academically stressed students. Regarding non-depressed students, a full parallel mediation model was found, whereas the model for depressed students inadequately explained the data. Conclusions: Overall, resilience and HE support mediate the predictive effect of academic stress on depressive symptoms among students. In addition, substantial differences in model fit arise when inspecting the students on a subgroup level. These findings contribute to the gap in knowledge regarding student wellbeing during the Covid-19 pandemic in the Netherlands, in addition to providing novel insights on student subgroup dynamics.

Growing evidence indicates that PARP-mediated ADPRylation events are key regulators of the protein biosynthetic pathway, leading from rDNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis to mRNA synthesis, processing, and translation. In this review we describe the role of PARP proteins and ADPRylation in all facets of this pathway. PARP-1 and its enzymatic activity are key regulators of rDNA transcription, which is a critical step in ribosome biogenesis. An emerging role of PARPs in alternative splicing of mRNAs, as well as direct ADPRylation of mRNAs, highlight the role of PARP members in RNA processing. Furthermore, PARP activity, stimulated by cellular stresses, such as viral infections and ER stress, leads to the regulation of mRNA stability and protein synthesis through posttranscriptional mechanisms. Dysregulation of PARP activity in these processes can promote disease states. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of PARP family members and ADPRylation in gene regulation, mRNA processing, and protein abundance. Future studies in these areas will yield new insights into the fundamental mechanisms and a broader utility for PARP-targeted therapeutic agents.",2020-03-01,"Kim, Dae-Seok; Challa, Sridevi; Jones, Aarin; Kraus, W.

From the medical records we recorded gender, age, mechanism of injury, trauma energy, fracture type based on the AO classification and severity of injury. RESULTS: As expected, we observed no difference in the number of fractures caused by simple falls. However, we failed to prove a reduction in the number of high-energy injuries. In contrary, we observed an increase in the number of high-energy injuries in the period between lockdowns (p=0.0375).

We were asked to devise a way to allow a community of children affected by the Rett genetic syndrome, and thus unable to communicate verbally, in writing or by gestures, to actively participate in remote rehabilitation and special education sessions by exploiting eye-gaze tracking. As not all subjects can access commercial eye-tracking devices, we investigated new ways to facilitate the access to eye gaze-based interaction for this specific case. The adopted communication platform is a videoconferencing software, so all we had at our disposal was a live video stream of the child.

Ill travellers represent a potential source for introduction of novel or antigenically drifted influenza virus strains to the United States. From May to September 2013–2015, the Alaska Division of Public Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and two cruise lines implemented a laboratory-based public health surveillance project to detect influenza and other respiratory viruses among ill crew members and passengers on select cruise ships in Alaska. METHODS: Cruise ship medical staff collected 2–3 nasopharyngeal swab specimens per week from passengers and crew members presenting to the ship infirmary with acute respiratory illness (ARI). Specimens were tested for respiratory viruses at the Alaska State Virology Laboratory (ASVL); a subset of specimens positive for influenza virus were sent to CDC for further antigenic characterization. RESULTS: Of 410 nasopharyngeal specimens, 83% tested positive for at least one respiratory virus; 71% tested positive for influenza A or B virus. Antigenic characterization of pilot project specimens identified strains matching predominant circulating seasonal influenza virus strains, which were included in the northern or southern hemisphere influenza vaccines during those years. Results were relatively consistent across age groups, recent travel history, and influenza vaccination status. Onset dates of illness relative to date of boarding differed between northbound (occurring later in the voyage) and southbound (occurring within the first days of the voyage) cruises. CONCLUSIONS: The high yield of positive results indicated that influenza was common among passengers and crews sampled with ARI. This finding reinforces the need to bolster influenza prevention and control activities on cruise ships. Laboratory-based influenza surveillance on cruise ships may augment inland influenza surveillance and inform control activities.

Currently, the most common detection methods for the virus are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and lateral flow tests. PCR takes more than an hour to obtain the results and lateral flow tests have difficulty with detecting the virus at low concentrations. In this study, 60 clinical human saliva samples, which included 30 positive and 30 negative samples confirmed with RT-PCR, were screened for COVID-19 using disposable glucose biosensor strips and a reusable printed circuit board. The disposable strips were gold plated and functionalized to immobilize antibodies on the gold film. After functionalization, the strips were connected to the gate electrode of a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor on the printed circuit board to amplify the test signals. A synchronous double-pulsed bias voltage was applied to the drain of the transistor and strips. The resulting change in drain waveforms was converted to digital readings. The RT-PCR-confirmed saliva samples were tested again using quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to determine cycling threshold (Ct) values. Ct values up to 45 refer to the number of amplification cycles needed to detect the presence of the virus. These PCR results were compared with digital readings from the sensor to better evaluate the sensor technology. The results indicate that the samples with a range of Ct values from 17.8 to 35 can be differentiated, which highlights the increased sensitivity of this sensor technology. This research exhibits the potential of this biosensor technology to be further developed into a cost-effective, point-of-care, and portable rapid detection method for SARS-CoV-2.",2022,"Chiu, C.

This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of thoracic fluid content (TFC) as a predictor of weaning outcome. METHODS: An observational cohort study included 64 critically ill surgical patients who were eligible for extubation. Before initiating the spontaneous breathing trial, the TFC was measured using the electrical cardiometry technology. Patients were followed up after extubation and divided into successful weaning group and failed weaning group. Both groups were compared according to respiratory and cardiovascular parameters. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the ability of TFC to predict weaning outcome. RESULTS: The number of successfully weaned patients was 41/64 (64%). Twenty (31%) patients had impaired cardiac contractility, and of them, 13/20 (64%) patients were successfully extubated. Both groups, successful weaning group and failed weaning group, were comparable in most of baseline characteristics; however, the TFC was significantly higher in the failed weaning group compared to the successful weaning group. The area under the ROC curves (AUCs) showed moderate predictive ability for the TFC in predicting weaning failure (AUC [95% confidence interval] 0.69 [0.57–0.8], cutoff value > 50 kΩ(−1)), while the predictive ability of TFC was excellent in the subgroup of patients with ejection fraction < 40% (AUC [95% confidence interval 0.93 [0.72–1], cutoff value > 50 kΩ(−1)).

We travel to different places such as Schools, Colleges, Restaurants, offices, and Hospitals. How do we adapt to these changes and refrain from getting the virus? Luckily, we have the technology to aid us. We are all used to biometric systems for marking our Presence/ Attendance in places like colleges, Offices, and Schools with fingerprint sensors, fingerprint sensors use our Fingerprint to mark our presence however Covid 19 has restricted the use of touch causing problems in marking attendance. One way to resolve the problem is using Artificial Intelligence by using a Recognizer to identify people with their face and iris features. We implement the Face Recognition and the Iris Recognition using two models which run concurrently, one to Recognize the Face by extracting the features of the face and passing the 128-d points to the Neural Network (Mobile net and Resnet Architecture). which gives the identity of the person whose image was matched with the trained database and the other by extracting iris features to recognize people. For extracting iris features we use the Gabor filter to extract features from the eyes which are then matched in the database for recognition using 3 distance-based matching algorithms city block distance, Euclidean distance, and cosine distance which gives an accuracy of 88.19%, 84.95%, and 85.42% respectively.

METHODS: Self-reported data from a migraine tracking smartphone application, Migraine Buddy, were used. Data were collected from users who reported at least one attack in the Jan, Feb, Mar and Apr of 2018, 2019 and 2020. In addition, a survey was conducted to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on migraine management. RESULTS: On average, data from 124,717 users per month (mean age 36.3 ± 10.9 years and 89% female) were collected. Overall, the mean frequency of migraine headache was higher in 2020 than in 2019 and higher in 2019 than in 2018. The four commonest headache triggers in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were stress in 39.7, 38.4 and 36.1%, lack of sleep in 25, 25 and 22.8%, neck pain, 20, 20.4 and 19.3 and anxiety in 19, 18.4 and 18.4% of participants, respectively. 1689 users participated in the survey and they reported that they preferred face-to-face (54.29%) to telehealth (11.9%) consultations. CONCLUSION: An increase in migraine frequency from 2018 to 2020 was reported by the users of the mobile phone. This could reflect a real increase or change in reporting habits. Stress, lack of sleep, neck pain and anxiety were the commonest attack triggers. The frequency of these triggers decreased slightly in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018.

As people migrate, they face a number of challenges including exposure to disease and other health threats, violence and assualt, trafficking and unlawful detention. However, of the protections avail-able to migrants, the implementation and realization of these protections and how they impact the individual experiences of migrants and their loss of human rights and dignity rights across the migration cycle, are lacking. In acknowledgement of this, McClain et al. developed a legal and policy framework for Migration with Dignity, which identified six fundamental elements central to the migration experience that can supplement and support the implementation of migrant protections. The framework was built upon the foundational policy of former President of Kiribati, Anote Tong, who understood the climate change was impacting the lives and livelihoods of his people and that in the face of diminishing land area and opportunities, that the Kiribati should have the opportunity to determine when and how they migrate, and that in doing so that they are able to live a life that is equal to or better than the one they left behind. The Migration with Dignity framework offers an opportunity to provide policy and legal options to governments, policy makers, and NGO’s for how to improve to consider the dignity of migrants while they move, and improve the transition of migrants into new set-tings, while also fostering opportunities for improved livelihoods. However, in order to provide these opportunities, the framework would benefit from additional application of the fundamental elements across different contexts and in different settings.

This consideration is of particular interest in view of the fact that health systems in many countries must address a growing public-sector deficit and respond to increasing pressures due to COVID-19 and aging population, among other factors. In line with a rapidly emerging literature, we focus on patient satisfaction as a proxy for quality of health care. Drawing on rich longitudinal and cross-sectional data for Spain and multilevel estimation techniques, we show that in addition to individual level differences, policy levers (such as public health spending and the patient-doctor ratio, in particular) exert a considerable influence on the quality of a health care system. Our results suggest that policymakers seeking to enhance the quality of care should be cautious when compromising the level of health resources, and in particular, health personnel, as a response to economic downturns in a sector that traditionally had insufficient human resources in many countries, which have become even more evident in the light of the current health crisis. Additionally, we provide evidence that the increasing reliance on the private health sector may be indicative of inefficiencies in the public system and/or the existence of features of private insurance which are deemed important by patients.",2021-10-21,"García-Corchero, Juan David; Jiménez-Rubio, Dolores",J Policy Model,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/50e5e7ad34e67c3885ae88f9dfdd303e3ed08e4c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8529896.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34703065/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpolmod.2021.09.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0161893821000922; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161893821000922?v=s5,239054189.0

Due to remote work recommendations and the closing of school premises and childcare centers, work–family boundaries became blurred in many families. In this study, we examine the possibly gendered boundary work practices among Finnish parents during the COVID‐19 lockdown in spring 2020 by asking, how do parents perceive the blurring of work–family boundaries? What kind of boundary work practices did families develop to manage their work and family roles, and were these practices gendered and how? Boundary practices are analyzed by combining theories of doing boundaries and gender theories in the context of the COVID‐19 pandemic and applying them to survey data. The results revealed that during lockdown, both spatial and temporal boundaries blurred or partly disappeared, and boundary practices developed by families were highly gendered. Especially in families where childcare practices had been gendered already before the lockdown, it was predominantly mothers, who shouldered the main responsibility of increased childcare and struggled to manage their work duties. Hence, families had varying means to cope with blurring boundaries based on their ability to switch to remote work, but also on their work–family practices before the pandemic.",2021-11-13,"Otonkorpi‐Lehtoranta, Katri; Salin, Milla; Hakovirta, Mia; Kaittila, Anniina",Gend Work Organ,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/34e1867b79d25b2cb9fde834742335dc0db0eb98.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8653353.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1111/gwao.12773; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34898870/,244110727.0

It remains unknown about small area-based spatiotemporal patterns of COVID-19 in the United States. METHODS: We obtained county-based counts of COVID-19 cases confirmed in the United States from January 22 to May 13, 2020 (N=1,386,050). We characterized the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic through detecting weekly hotspots of newly confirmed cases using Spatial and Space-Time Scan Statistics and quantifying the trends of incidence of COVID-19 by county characteristics using the Joinpoint analysis. RESULTS: Along with the national plateau reached in early April, COVID-19 incidence significantly decreased in the Northeast (estimated weekly percentage changes [EWPC]: -16.6%), but remained increasing in the Midwest, South and West Regions (EWPCs: 13.2%, 5.6%, and 5.7%, respectively). Higher risks of clustering and incidence of COVID-19 were consistently observed in metropolitan vs rural counties, counties closest to core airports, most populous counties, and counties with highest proportion of racial/ethnic minority counties. However, geographic differences in the incidence have shrunk since early April, driven by a significant decrease in the incidence in these counties (EWPC range: -2.0% – -4.2%) and a consistent increase in other areas (EWPC range: 1.5% – 20.3%). CONCLUSIONS: To substantially decrease the nationwide incidence of COVID-19, strict social distancing measures should be continuously implemented, especially in geographic areas with increasing risks, including rural areas.

The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the safety and feasibility of unique gallbladder retraction methods using an ENDOLOOP® (Ethicon, Tokyo, Japan) and Lapaherclosure™ (Hakko Medical, Tokyo, Japan). MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE From May 2013 to April 2015, 77 patients underwent single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy with this retraction technique. During the same period, conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in 85 patients; these patients were the control group. The patients' data, including the operative time, total blood loss, conversion rate to laparotomy, and perioperative complications, were compared. Alexis® Wound Retractor XS (Applied Medical, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted through a 25-30-mm vertical transumbilical incision to prevent bile contamination. Next, a SILS Port (Covidien, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted. A flexible 5-mm laparoscope was inserted through the port with a grasper (SILS Clinch, Covidien) and a normal 5-mm scalpel. The fundus of the gallbladder was tied by the ENDOLOOP. The Lapaherclosure was then directly inserted through a right lower intercostal space to capture and pull the Lapaherclosure out. After the cystic artery and duct were cut, the resected gallbladder was directly extracted from the umbilical incision. DISCUSSION Several methods and devices have been developed to perform single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy, including the suturing method, the Mini Loop Retractor II (Covidien), and the EndoGrab (Virtual Ports, Caesarea, Israel). However, considering medical costs and safety, our retraction method seems to be feasible and comparable to existing methods.",2019,"Funamizu, Naotake; Okamoto, Tomoyoshi; Kumamoto, Tomotaka; Kazama, Takashi; Watanabe, Atsushi; Fujioka, Shuichi; Yanaga, Katsuhiko",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12614; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30549252/,56483594.0

The fact that, soon afterward, the two million people Slovenia was the first European country proclaiming the end of COVID-19 epidemic within national borders may be relevant from this perspective. Motivated by this evolution, in this paper the time dynamics of coronavirus cases in Slovenia is investigated with emphasis on how efficient various containment measures act to diminish the number of COVID-19 infections. Noteworthily, the present analysis does not rely on any speculative theoretical assumption; it is solely based on raw epidemiological data. Out of the results presented here, the most important one is perhaps the finding that, while imposing drastic curfews and travel restrictions reduce the infection rate &#954; by a factor of four with respect to the unrestricted state, they only improve the &#954;-value by &#8776;15% as compared to the much bearable state of social and economic life wherein wearing face masks and social distancing rules are enforced/followed.

With the limited supply of face masks in the market and the uncertainty about the future development of COVID-19, reusing face masks is a legitimate way to reduce usage. Although this practice is not recommended, reusing face masks is common in Hong Kong. This study aimed to examine the practice of reusing face masks among adults in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic and its association with their health beliefs toward this health crisis. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. A quota sample of 1000 adults was recruited in Hong Kong in April 2020. Guided by the Health Belief Model, the subjects were invited to answer questions on their practice of reusing face masks and health beliefs toward COVID-19 through telephone interview. Their practice on reuse, storage, and decontamination of used face masks were summarized by descriptive statistics. The difference in health beliefs between the subjects who reused and did not reuse face masks was examined by conducting an independent t test. The association between health beliefs and reuse of face masks was determined by conducting a logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: One-third (n = 345, 35.4%) of the subjects reused face masks in an average of 2.5 days. Among them, 207 subjects stored and 115 subjects decontaminated their used face masks by using various methods. The subjects who reused face masks significantly perceived having inadequate face masks (t = 3.905; p < 0.001). Having a higher level of perception of having inadequate face masks increased the likelihood of reusing face masks (OR = 0.784; CI 95%: 0.659–0.934; p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Despite having 90 face masks in stock, the adults who reused face masks significantly perceived that they had inadequate face masks.

We aim to audit our practice during the initial COVID-19 pandemic. Materials & Methods: A retrospective analysis of 94 patients admitted with ureteric colic during the initial COVID-19 pandemic (March to June 2020). Data was collected from records and outcomes compared to a pre-pandemic audit of our acute stone service (January to June 2018). Results: Patient demographics were comparable: 33 admissions/month (pre-COVID 37), average age 52 years (pre-COVID 53 years), and median stone size 6 mm (pre-COVID 5mm). Septic patients (23%, pre-COVID 17%) underwent ureteric stenting (23%, pre-COVID 17%) or nephrostomy (10%, pre-COVID <1%). For non-septic patients, 46% underwent primary treatment (ureteroscopy:ESWL = 1:1, pre-COVID = 2:1), 24% ureteric stenting (pre-COVID 31%) and 30% conservative management (pre-COVID 34%). Median time to primary ureteroscopy (94% successful) and ESWL (76% successful;1-2 sessions) was 24 hours (target <48 hours). Median time from stent insertion to definite ureteroscopy was 5.8 weeks (pre-COVID 6.6 weeks, target <4 weeks) and subsequent cystoscopic stent removal was 4 weeks (target <2 weeks). For patients managed conservatively, median time to outpatient review was 7.1 weeks (pre-COVID 5.4 weeks, target <4 weeks) and follow-up imaging 8.2 weeks. Conclusions: These results from one of the largest stone units in the UK show, that despite the pandemic, primary stone intervention was still achievable within 24 hours.

Despite similar global rates of infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic), hospitalizations and mortality are higher in men than in women. Females may be less vulnerable to viral infection due to sex-based differences in immune responses and renin-angiotensin system activity. The response and side effects of currently studied potential therapies for COVID-19, such as hydroxychloroquine, likely differ by sex. Women form the majority of the health care workforce and a uniform approach to sizing of personal protective equipment may provide differing levels of protection from viral infection to health care workers of varying shapes and sizes. Important gender differences exist in the response to public health measures to prevent and contain spread of COVID-19, as well as presentation for testing and medical care, which may inadvertently propagate viral spread.

These data are captured by 1 of 13 laboratory information management systems (LIMSs) developed specifically for veterinary diagnostic laboratories (VDLs). Beginning ~2000, the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) developed an electronic messaging system for LIMS to automatically send standardized data streams for 14 select agents to a national repository. This messaging enables the U.S. Department of Agriculture to track and respond to high-consequence animal disease outbreaks such as highly pathogenic avian influenza. Because of the lack of standardized data collection in the LIMSs used at VDLs, there is, to date, no means of summarizing VDL large data streams for multi-state and national animal health studies or for providing near-real-time tracking for hundreds of other important animal diseases in the United States that are detected routinely by VDLs. Further, VDLs are the only state and federal resources that can provide early detection and identification of endemic and emerging zoonotic diseases. Zoonotic diseases are estimated to be responsible for 2.5 billion cases of human illness and 2.7 million deaths worldwide every year.

Knowledge about how HCWs are connected to the care of critically ill patients with COVID-19 is important for characterizing the relationships among team structures, care quality, and patient safety. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to discover differences in the teamwork structures of COVID-19 critical care by comparing HCW collaborations in the management of critically ill patients with and without COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we used network analysis methods to analyze the electronic health records (EHRs) of 76 critically ill patients (with COVID-19: n=38; without COVID-19: n=38) who were admitted to a large academic medical center, and to learn about HCW collaboration. We used the EHRs of adult patients who were admitted to the COVID-19 ICU at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Nashville, Tennessee, United States) between March 17, 2020, and May 31, 2020. We matched each patient according to age, gender, and their length of stay. Patients without COVID-19 were admitted to the medical ICU between December 1, 2019, and February 29, 2020. We used two sociometrics—eigencentrality and betweenness—to quantify HCWs’ statuses in networks. Eigencentrality characterizes the degree to which an HCW is a core person in collaboration structures. Betweenness centrality refers to whether an HCW lies on the path of other HCWs who are not directly connected. This sociometric was used to characterize HCWs’ broad skill sets. We measured patient staffing intensity in terms of the number of HCWs who interacted with patients’ EHRs. We assessed the statistical differences in the core and betweenness statuses of HCWs and the patient staffing intensities of COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 critical care, by using Mann-Whitney U tests and reporting 95% CIs. RESULTS: HCWs in COVID-19 critical care were more likely to frequently work with each other (eigencentrality: median 0.096) than those in non–COVID-19 critical care (eigencentrality: median 0.057; P<.001). Internal medicine physicians in COVID-19 critical care had higher core statuses than those in non–COVID-19 critical care (P=.001). Nurse practitioners in COVID-19 care had higher betweenness statuses than those in non–COVID-19 care (P<.001). Compared to HCWs in non–COVID-19 settings, the EHRs of critically ill patients with COVID-19 were used by a larger number of internal medicine nurse practitioners (P<.001), cardiovascular nurses (P<.001), and surgical ICU nurses (P=.002) and a smaller number of resident physicians (P<.001).

More than 100 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are approved or in late stage clinical trials, many of which harness the potent FcγR‐mediated effector systems to varying degrees. This is most evident for antibodies targeting cancer cells inducing antibody‐dependent killing or phagocytosis but is also true to some degree for the mAbs that neutralize or remove small macromolecules such as cytokines or other Igs. The use of mAb therapeutics has also revealed a “scaffolding” role for FcγR which, in different contexts, may either underpin the therapeutic mAb action such as immune agonism or trigger catastrophic adverse effects. The still unmet therapeutic need in many cancers, inflammatory diseases or emerging infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) requires increased effort on the development of improved and novel mAbs. A more mature appreciation of the immunobiology of individual FcγR function and the complexity of the relationships between FcγRs and antibodies is fueling efforts to develop more potent “next‐gen” therapeutic antibodies. Such development strategies now include focused glycan or protein engineering of the Fc to increase affinity and/or tailor specificity for selective engagement of individual activating FcγRs or the inhibitory FcγRIIb or alternatively, for the ablation of FcγR interaction altogether.

Over the last decade, robotic lobectomy has shown to be safe, with oncologic efficacy similar to lobectomy via thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Comparative analysis between these modalities is an active area of investigation. While initially expensive, the costs of a robotic platform decrease as the number of operations performed increases, length of stay is shortened, and postoperative morbidity is reduced. Moreover, the added cost has value which is defined over long periods of time. Areas covered: The clinical technique and optimal conduct of lobectomy is explained in granular detail for all five types of lobectomies. The advantages and disadvantages of a robotic platform are analyzed, including a review of the recent literature. Expert commentary: The number of robotic pulmonary resections performed has tripled in the past two years. Anticipated developments in robotic surgery include improvements in robotic training, continued refinement of robotic instrumentation, and additional adjunctive technologies.

The lack of knowledge on the precise mechanism of viral pathogenesis is impeding medical intervention. In this study, we have taken both in silico and in vitro experimental approaches to unravel the mechanism of viral pathogenesis associated with complement and coagulation pathways. Based on the structural similarities of viral and host proteins, we initially generated a protein-protein interactome profile. Further computational analysis combined with Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and KEGG pathway analysis predicted key annotated pathways associated with viral pathogenesis. These include MAPK signaling, complement, and coagulation cascades, endocytosis, PD-L1 expression, PD-1 checkpoint pathway in cancer and C-type lectin receptor signaling pathways. Degree centrality analysis pinned down to MAPK1, MAPK3, AKT1, and SRC are crucial drivers of signaling pathways and often overlap with the associated pathways. Most strikingly, the complement and coagulation cascade and platelet activation pathways are interconnected, presumably directing thrombotic activity observed in severe or critical cases of COVID-19. This is complemented by in vitro studies of Huh7 cell infection and analysis of the transcriptome and proteomic profile of gene candidates during viral infection. The most known candidates associated with complement and coagulation cascade signaling by KEGG pathway analysis showed significant up-regulated fold change during viral infection. Collectively both in silico and in vitro studies suggest complement and coagulation cascade signaling are a mechanism for intravascular coagulation, thrombotic changes, and associated complications in severe COVID-19 patients.",2020,"Tiwari, Ritudhwaj; Mishra, Anurag R; Mikaeloff, Flora; Gupta, Soham; Mirazimi, Ali; Byrareddy, Siddappa N; Neogi, Ujjwal; Nayak, Debasis",,,#919689,,,,,226300361.0

Two hundred and forty scouring lambs, and 25 healthy lambs selected as control, were used in this trial. The faecal samples from the scouring lambs were positive to non-enterotoxigenic E. coli. All the scouring lambs received supportive care and they were randomly allotted to two groups of 120 animals (treated group and untreated group). The lambs in the treated group were given two daily doses of 20 mg/kg live weight spectinomycin for 3 days, while the other group of lambs (untreated group) did not receive any antibiotic. Serum endotoxin was higher in the treated lambs. The combined infection of E. coli + Proteus mirabilis was the most frequent microbiological result in the deceased treated lambs, while the only enteric pathogen isolated in the untreated lambs submitted to necroscopy was E. coli. The pathological findings most commonly recorded in the untreated lambs were suggestive of a generalized inflammatory process attributed to colibacilosis, while the lesions in the treated lambs might correspond to an enterotoxoemic process. The overproduction of P. mirabilis might be consequence of the antibiotic treatment and it would be the most probable cause of the endotoxemia, the high mortality rate and the pathological findings in the treated lambs.

lycigsv1,,WHO,Early awake proning in critical and severe COVID-19 patients undergoing noninvasive respiratory support: A retrospective multicenter cohort study,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND/MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in two teaching hospitals over a 3-month period (March 2010-June 2020) comparing severe and critical COVID-19 patients admitted to Respiratory Intensive Care Unit for non-invasive respiratory support (NRS) and subjected to awake prone position (PP) with those receiving standard care (SC). Primary outcome was endotracheal intubation (ETI) rate. In-hospital mortality, time to ETI, tracheostomy, length of RICU and hospital stay served as secondary outcomes. Risk factors associated to ETI among PP patients were also investigated. RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were included, 76 in the SC and 38 in the PP group. Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates showed greater effect of PP compared to SC on ETI rate (HRâ¯=â¯0.45 95% CI [0.2-0.9], pâ¯=â¯0.02) even after adjustment for baseline confounders (HRâ¯=â¯0.59 95% CI [0.3-0.94], pâ¯=â¯0.03). After stratification according to non-invasive respiratory support, PP showed greater significant benefit for those on High Flow Nasal Cannulae (HRâ¯=â¯0.34 95% CI [0.12-0.84], pâ¯=â¯0.04). Compared to SC, PP patients also showed a favorable difference in terms of days free from respiratory support, length of RICU and hospital stay while mortality and tracheostomy rate were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Prone positioning in awake and spontaneously breathing Covid-19 patients is feasible and associated with a reduction of intubation rate, especially in those patients undergoing HFNC.

It has been determined to be caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). With the global pandemic, the lack of efficient rapid and accurate molecular diagnostic testing tools has hindered the public opportunely response to the emerging viral threat. Herein, a DNA nanoscaffold hybrid chain reaction (DNHCR)-based nucleic acid assay strategy is reported for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In this method, the DNA nanoscaffolds have been first constructed by the self-assembly of long DNA strands and self-quenching probes (H1). Then, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA will initiate the hybridization of H1 and free H2 DNA probes along the nanoscaffold, and an illuminated DNA nanostring is instantly obtained. By taking advantages of the localization design of the H1 probes and the temperature tolerance of the isothermal amplification, the proposed DNHCR method can detect target at short responding time (within 10 min) and mild condition (15°C–35 °C). Moreover, the reliability of DNHCR method in serum and saliva samples have also been validated. Therefore, DNHCR-based method is expected to provide a simple and faster alternative to the traditional SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR assay.",2020-07-29,"Jiao, Jin; Duan, Chengjie; Xue, Lan; Liu, Yunfei; Sun, Weihao; Xiang, Yang",Biosens Bioelectron,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e2da2353b95d95071ecea99495c80cf30dd493f2.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7387931.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32763826/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2020.112479; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566320304723; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566320304723?v=s5,220837248.0

High rates of HGT increase the genetic pool and the effective population size (N(e)), resulting in open pan-genomes. In contrast, selective pressures can lead to local adaptation by purging the variation introduced by HGT and mutation, resulting in closed pan-genomes and clonal lineages. In this study, we explored both hypotheses, elucidating the pan-genome of Vibrionaceae isolates after a perturbation event in the endangered oasis of Cuatro Ciénegas Basin (CCB), Mexico, and looking for signals of adaptation to the environments in their genomes. RESULTS: We obtained 42 genomes of Vibrionaceae distributed in six lineages, two of them did not showed any close reference strain in databases. Five of the lineages showed closed pan-genomes and were associated to either water or sediment environment; their high N(e) estimates suggest that these lineages are not from a recent origin. The only clade with an open pan-genome was found in both environments and was formed by ten genetic groups with low N(e), suggesting a recent origin. The recombination and mutation estimators (r/m) ranged from 0.005 to 2.725, which are similar to oceanic Vibrionaceae estimations. However, we identified 367 gene families with signals of positive selection, most of them found in the core genome; suggesting that despite recombination, natural selection moves the Vibrionaceae CCB lineages to local adaptation, purging the genomes and keeping closed pan-genome patterns. Moreover, we identify 598 SNPs associated with an unstructured environment; some of the genes associated with these SNPs were related to sodium transport. CONCLUSIONS: Different lines of evidence suggest that the sampled Vibrionaceae, are part of the rare biosphere usually living under famine conditions. Two of these lineages were reported for the first time. Most Vibrionaceae lineages of CCB are adapted to their micro-habitats rather than to the sampled environments.

Yet global consumption of these products is rising due to profound changes in production, processing, manufacturing, marketing, retail, and consumption practices, alongside the growth of the resources and political influence of Big Food. Whilst the sales of UPFs and UPBs in high-income countries (HICs) are stagnating, sales are rapidly expanding in more populous middle-income countries (MICs). In this paper, we adopt a political economy of food systems approach to understand how growth of Big Food in MICs drives the NCD pandemic. METHODS We conducted a mixed methods synthesis review. This involved quantitative data collection and development of descriptive statistics; a search for academic, market and grey literature on the expansion of UPF in MICs; and the development of themes, three illustrative case examples (South Africa, Colombia, and Indonesia), and synthesis of the enablers of successful campaigns in MICs into recommendations for public health campaigns. RESULTS We project that the combined sales volume of UPFs in MICs will reach equivalency with HICs by 2024, and the total sales volume of UPBs in MICs is already significantly higher than in HICs. Similarly, annual growth in UPF sales is higher in MICs compared to HICs. We also show how Big Food has entrenched its presence within MICs through establishing global production and hyper-local distribution networks, scaling up its marketing, challenging government policies and scientific expertise, and co-opting civil society. We argue that public health can counter the influence of Big Food by developing an expanded global network of driven and passionate people with diverse skillsets, and advocating for increased government leadership.

It presents retrieved documents in an order of their estimated degrees of relevance to query. Traditional document ranking methods are mostly based on the similarity computations between documents and query. In this paper we argue that the similarity-based document ranking is insufficient in some cases. There are two reasons. Firstly it is about the increased information variety. There are far too many different types documents available now for user to search. The second is about the users variety. In many cases user may want to retrieve documents that are not only similar but also general or broad regarding a certain topic. This is particularly the case in some domains such as bio-medical IR. In this paper we propose a novel approach to re-rank the retrieved documents by incorporating the similarity with their generality. By an ontology-based analysis on the semantic cohesion of text, document generality can be quantified. The retrieved documents are then re-ranked by their combined scores of similarity and the closeness of documents’ generality to the query’s.

Comprehensive pathological descriptions of COVID-19 are scarce and limited in scope. We aimed to describe the histopathological findings and viral tropism in patients who died of severe COVID-19. Methods: In this case series, patients were considered eligible if they were older than 18 years, with premortem diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and COVID-19 listed clinically as the direct cause of death. Between March 1 and April 30, 2020, full post-mortem examinations were done on nine patients with confirmed COVID-19, including sampling of all major organs. A limited autopsy was done on one additional patient. Histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses were done, and histopathological findings were reported by subspecialist pathologists. Viral quantitative RT-PCR analysis was done on tissue samples from a subset of patients. Findings: The median age at death of our cohort of ten patients was 73 years (IQR 52-79). Thrombotic features were observed in at least one major organ in all full autopsies, predominantly in the lung (eight [89%] of nine patients), heart (five [56%]), and kidney (four [44%]). Diffuse alveolar damage was the most consistent lung finding (all ten patients); however, organisation was noted in patients with a longer clinical course. We documented lymphocyte depletion (particularly CD8-positive T cells) in haematological organs and haemophagocytosis. Evidence of acute tubular injury was noted in all nine patients examined. Major unexpected findings were acute pancreatitis (two [22%] of nine patients), adrenal micro-infarction (three [33%]), pericarditis (two [22%]), disseminated mucormycosis (one [10%] of ten patients), aortic dissection (one [11%] of nine patients), and marantic endocarditis (one [11%]). Viral genomes were detected outside of the respiratory tract in four of five patients. The presence of subgenomic viral RNA transcripts provided evidence of active viral replication outside the respiratory tract in three of five patients. Interpretation: Our series supports clinical data showing that the four dominant interrelated pathological processes in severe COVID-19 are diffuse alveolar damage, thrombosis, haemophagocytosis, and immune cell depletion. Additionally, we report here several novel autopsy findings including pancreatitis, pericarditis, adrenal micro-infarction, secondary disseminated mucormycosis, and brain microglial activation, which require additional investigation to understand their role in COVID-19.

Neurosurgical patients are often critically ill and at particularly high risk for COVID, and the pandemic has produced ever-shifting circumstances to allow their continued care. This study explores the psychologic impact of the pandemic on neurosurgical residents at a single institution. METHODS: Residents completed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Inventory of Depressive Symptomology 30 (IDS-30), two validated surveys, before and during the pandemic. PSS scores range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicative of increased stress. IDS-30 ranges from 0 to 84 with higher scores indicating more severe levels of depression. Survey results were compared collectively among residents and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The surveys had 19 out of 28 total responders (68%). Mean score on the PSS was 16.1 prepandemic and 14.7 during the pandemic (P > 0.05). The mean score on the IDS-30 was 14.7 prepandemic and 12.0 during the pandemic (P > 0.05). Matching the survey questionnaire results by each resident revealed an average decrease of 2.3 and 2.4 for the PSS and IDS-30, respectively.

Furthermore, we distinguish between the impact of the lockdown, which affected the entire territory by mid-March, from the effect of the number of new confirmed positive COVID-19 cases at the municipal level. Our results show strong stockpiling effects for most of the products in the first week of adoption of the lockdown measures. On the other hand, the number of new cases at the municipal level is associated with reductions in sales, pointing towards increased fears of being infected as the main driver of the slowdown in sales.

In this scenario increasing plants nitrogen (N) use efficiency and minimizing energy losses coming from photorespiration are long-pursued traits for crops breeding. Plastidic glutamine synthetase (GS2) enzyme stands at the crossroad of N assimilation and photorespiration and thus, appears as a key candidate for the improvement of crops performance. GS2 has been considered for a long time as an essential enzyme for angiosperms survival under photorespiratory conditions. Surprisingly, in Arabidopsis, GS2 is not essential for plant survival and its absence confers tolerance towards ammonium stress, which clashes with the traditional assumption that NH4 + accumulation is a main cause of ammonium stress. Altogether, it appears that the GS2 ""textbook"" view of this enzyme must be revisited, especially regarding: 1) its essentiality for plants growth under photorespiratory conditions and 2) the role of NH4 + assimilation during ammonium stress.

We implemented a HAVI prevention bundle in 2015, which included 6 core elements: caregiver screening, symptom-based isolation, personal protective equipment (PPE), hand hygiene, staff illness procedures, and monitoring of environmental cleanliness. Enhanced bundle elements were introduced at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which provided an opportunity to observe the effectiveness of the bundle with optimal adherence to prevention practices, and to measure the impact on respiratory HAVI epidemiology. METHODS Respiratory HAVIs were confirmed through review of medical records and application of the National Health Safety Network (NHSN) surveillance criteria for upper respiratory infections (URIs) with pre-determined incubation periods for unit attribution. Descriptive statistics of the study population were examined, and comparative analyses were performed on demographic and process metrics. Data analysis was conducted using R statistical software. RESULTS We observed an overall decrease in respiratory HAVI of 68%, with pre-pandemic rates of 0.19 infections per 1000 patient significantly decreased to a rate of 0.06 per 1000 patient days in the pandemic period (P<0.01). Rhinovirus made up proportionally more of our respiratory HAVI in the pandemic period (64% vs 53%), with respiratory HAVI secondary only to rhinovirus identified during 8 of 16 months in the pandemic period. Compliance with our HAVI prevention bundle significantly improved during pandemic period. CONCLUSIONS Enhancement of our HAVI bundle during the COVID-19 pandemic contributed toward significant reduction in nosocomial transmission of respiratory HAVI. Even with prevention practices optimized, respiratory HAVIs secondary to rhinovirus continued to be reported, likely due to the capacity of rhinovirus to evade bundle elements in hospital, and infection prevention efforts at large in the community, leaving vulnerable patients at continued risk.",2022-05-16,"Kitt, Eimear; Brennan, Lauren; Harrison, Cecelia; Hei, Hillary; Paul, Elina; Satchell, Lauren; Wilson, Kimberly; Smathers, Sarah; Handy, Lori; Coffin, Susan E",American journal of infection control,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2022.04.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35588914/,248851091.0

We present a quantitative analysis to address the hypothesis that bats are unique in their propensity to host zoonotic viruses based on a comparison with rodents, another important host order. We found that bats indeed host more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents, and we identified life-history and ecological factors that promote zoonotic viral richness. More zoonotic viruses are hosted by species whose distributions overlap with a greater number of other species in the same taxonomic order (sympatry). Specifically in bats, there was evidence for increased zoonotic viral richness in species with smaller litters (one young), greater longevity and more litters per year. Furthermore, our results point to a new hypothesis to explain in part why bats host more zoonotic viruses per species: the stronger effect of sympatry in bats and more viruses shared between bat species suggests that interspecific transmission is more prevalent among bats than among rodents. Although bats host more zoonotic viruses per species, the total number of zoonotic viruses identified in bats (61) was lower than in rodents (68), a result of there being approximately twice the number of rodent species as bat species. Therefore, rodents should still be a serious concern as reservoirs of emerging viruses.

There have been different names for the greater China area, such as ‘the Chinese circle’, ‘the Chinese community’, ‘the greater China community’, ‘China economic circle’, ‘Chinese economic area’, ‘China economic zone’, and so on. Probably first used by George Cressey at least as far back as the 1930s, the term ‘Greater China’ was to refer to the entire Chinese empire, as opposed to China proper (Harding, 1993, p. 660). The term ‘Greater China’ is now generally used for referring to the cultural and economic ties between the relevant territories, and is not intended to imply sovereignty. Sometimes, to avoid any political connotation, the term Chinese-speaking world is often used instead of the Greater China. Despite the common historical, cultural, and linguistic homogeneity, the greater China economic area has followed different routes of economic developments. Hong Kong and Macau have been under the colonial administrations of the UK and of Portugal, respectively. Taiwan was a Japanese colony between 1895 and 1945 and, following a short period of reunification with mainland China, has been operating independently from the rest of the world. As a result, significant social and economic differences have been present in the four parts of the area, especially since 1949. The Taiwan Strait became a forbidden boundary in 1949 when the Nationalist-led government fled to Taiwan and, at the same time, the Communist-led government was founded on the mainland. Since then, Taiwan and mainland China have been two divergent regimes. Against the common cultural and linguistic homogeneity, mainland China chose essentially to pursue a socialist line, while Taiwan followed the route of market-oriented capitalism. Furthermore, the two sides have also treated each other antagonistically, particularly during the high tide of military confrontation, when the mainland claimed that it would liberate the Taiwan compatriots from the black society sooner or later, while in turn Taiwan maintained that they would use the ‘three democratisms’ to reoccupy the mainland eventually. The Chinese people have a long history of migrating overseas. One of the migrations dates back to the Ming dynasty when Zheng He (1371–1435) became the envoy of the Ming emperor. He sent people – many of them Cantonese and Hokkien – to explore and trade in the South China Sea and in the Indian Ocean. Different waves of immigration led to subgroups among overseas Chinese such as the new and old immigrants in Southeast Asia, North America, Oceania, the Caribbean, Latin America, South Africa, and Russia. From the mid-nineteenth century onward, emigration has been directed primarily to Western countries (such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, and Western Europe). Many of these emigrants were themselves overseas Chinese or were from Taiwan or Hong Kong, particularly from the 1950s to the 1970s, a period during which the PRC placed severe restrictions on the movement of its citizens. In 1984, Britain agreed to transfer the sovereignty of Hong Kong to the PRC; this triggered another wave of migration to the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, USA, Latin America, and the other parts of the world. The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 further accelerated the migration. The wave calmed after Hong Kong’s transfer of sovereignty in 1997. In addition, many citizens of Hong Kong hold citizenships or have current visas in other countries so if the need arises, they can leave Hong Kong at short notice.

Passive processes of structure marginalization relegate social structures to the margin of experience without the use of higher-order cognitive acts such as evaluation and reflection. Examples include adapting to social structures via routine and habitual practices (material reification), a lack of conscious awareness of the complexity, historical formation, and other details of social structures (ignorance), and rendering social structures irrelevant when they are unreflectively judged to be of no value for achieving ends (nullification). Active processes of structure marginalization reflectively and discursively relegate social structures to marginal consciousness. Examples include the use of naturalistic and necessitarian explanations for the social order that implicitly justify it as inalterable or “just the way things are” (discursive reification), normative justifications for the status quo (legitimation), and conscious awareness of one’s powerlessness to control social-structural conditions (helplessness).

Public compliance poses a challenge when implementing large-scale social restrictions, and various factors have contributed to public non-compliance with the regulation. This study aimed to determine the degree of non-compliance and identify the factors that contributed to public non-compliance with the PSBB in Greater Jakarta, Indonesia. METHODS: This was a quantitative study with a cross-sectional design. A total of 839 residents of Greater Jakarta participated in this study. Data were collected online using a Google Form, and convenience sampling was undertaken. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to explore the relationships between public non-compliance with the PSBB regulation and socio-demographic variables, respondents’ opinion of the PSBB, and social capital. RESULTS: A total of 22.6% of subjects reported participating in activities that did not comply with the PSBB. The variables that most affected non-compliance with the PSBB were age, gender, income, opinion of the PSBB, and social capital. CONCLUSIONS: Strengthening social capital and providing information about COVID-19 prevention measures, such as washing one’s hands with soap, wearing masks properly, and maintaining social distancing, is essential.

A Proposed Ethical Framework for Allocating Scarce Medical Resources to COVID-19 Patients Using Fuzzy Logic,10.3389/fmed.2021.600415,PMC8020032,33829020,cc-by,"COVID-19 is a global pandemic that affected the everyday life activities of billions around the world. It is an unprecedented crisis that the modern world had never experienced before. It mainly affected the economic state and the health care system. The rapid and increasing number of infected patients overwhelmed the healthcare infrastructure, which causes high demand and, thus, shortage in the required staff members and medical resources. This shortage necessitates practical and ethical suggestions to guide clinicians and medical centers when allocating and reallocating scarce resources for and between COVID-19 patients. Many studies proposed a set of ethical principles that should be applied and implemented to address this problem. In this study, five different ethical principles based on the most commonly recommended principles and aligned with WHO guidelines and state-of-the-art practices proposed in the literature were identified, and recommendations for their applications were discussed. Furthermore, a recent study highlighted physicians' propensity to apply a combination of more than one ethical principle while prioritizing the medical resource allocation. Based on that, an ethical framework that is based on Fuzzy inference systems was proposed. The proposed framework's input is the identified ethical principles, and the output is a weighted value (per patient). This value can be used as a rank or a priority factor given to the patients based on their condition and other relevant information, like the severity of their disease status. The main idea of implementing fuzzy logic in the framework is to combine more than one principle when calculating the weighted value, hence mimicking what some physicians apply in practice. Moreover, the framework's rules are aligned with the identified ethical principles. This framework can help clinicians and guide them while making critical decisions to allocate/reallocate the limited medical resources during the current COVID-19 crisis and future similar pandemics.",2021-03-22,"Saadeh, Heba; Saadeh, Maha; Almobaideen, Wesam",Front Med (Lausanne),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/3e92f359e8f521aeef6be06f1783f688b808890f.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8020032.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33829020/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.600415,232291445.0

znlomowf,,WHO,Endocrine and metabolic aspects of COVID-19,,,,unk,"The paper presents the theoretical considerations on the role of endocrine and metabolic alterations accompanying COVID-19 infection. These alterations may be presumed on the basis of the following two observations. Firstly, the virus SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the COVID-19 infection uses an important renin-angiotensin system (RAS) element - angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - as a receptor protein for entry into target cells and, in consequence, disturbs the function of the main (circulating) renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and of the local renin-angiotensin system localized in different tissues and organs. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 leads to the downregulation of this enzyme and, in the aftermath, to the excess of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Thus, in the later stage of COVID-19 infection, the beneficial effects of ACEI and ARB could be presumed. It is hypothesized that the local RAS dysregulation in the adipose tissue is the main cause of the negative role of obesity as a risk factor of severe outcome of the COVID-19 infection. Secondly, the outcome of COVID-19 strongly depends on the age of the patient. Age-related hormonal deficiencies, especially those of melatonin and dehydroepiandrosterone, may contribute to morbidity/mortality in older people. The usefulness of melatonin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor 1 blockers (the latter only in later phases of the infection) as adjuvant drugs is probable but needs thorough clinical trials.",2021,"Pawlikowski, Marek; Winczyk, Katarzyna",Endokrynol Pol,,#covidwho-1234896,,,,,234791812.0

Many existing FL systems, based on centralized (often single) model aggregators are unable to scale to handle large FL jobs and adapt to parties' behavior.

First, we demonstrate how traditional tree overlay based aggregation techniques (from P2P, publish-subscribe and stream processing research) can help FL aggregation scale, but are ineffective from a resource utilization and cost standpoint. Next, we present the design and implementation of AdaFed, which uses serverless/cloud functions to adaptively scale aggregation in a resource efficient and fault tolerant manner. We describe how AdaFed enables FL aggregation to be dynamically deployed only when necessary, elastically scaled to handle participant joins/leaves and is fault tolerant with minimal effort required on the (aggregation) programmer side.

METHODS: In this study, 144 puerperants with gestational hypertension admitted to our hospital were included and divided into a research group and a control group according to the nursing method. The control group (n = 72) adopted the routine nursing and the observation group (n = 72) adopted the high-quality nursing. The rate of postpartum hemorrhage, the incidence of eclampsia, the amount of 1 d-postpartum hemorrhage, the quality of life (QOL), the psychological states, and the nursing satisfaction were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The rate of postpartum hemorrhage, the incidence of eclampsia, and the amount of 1 d-postpartum hemorrhage of the patients in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group (all P < 0.05). After intervention, the scores of psychological states in both groups decreased, which dropped more in the observation group (all P < 0.05). The scores of physical function, overall health, social function, and emotional role in the observation group were significantly higher than those in the control group (all P < 0.05). The patients' satisfaction on nursing in the observation group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: High-quality nursing has certain advantages in improving postpartum hemorrhage and QOL in puerperants with gestational hypertension. It can also improve patients' negative emotions, life quality, and nursing satisfaction.",2022,"Ouyang, Yan; Liu, Xiaolan; He, Zhixiu; Huang, Donghua",Am J Transl Res,,#mdl-35173847,,,,,246903021.0

However, to our knowledge, association of COVID-19 with bradycardia has not been reported. This case study describes sinus bradycardia as a potential manifestation of COVID-19. This is a retrospective case series of four patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, admitted to St. Luke’s University Health Network ICU between 24 March 2020 and 5 April 2020. Medical records of these patients were reviewed using the EPIC electronic health record system. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were reviewed against periods of bradycardia in each patient. The patient group comprised two males and two females. Two patients had pre-existing cardiovascular (CV) comorbidities but no history of arrythmias. Heart rates ranged between 66 and 88 beats/min on admission. The lowest rates during bradycardia were between 42 and 49 beats/min. The onset of sinus bradycardia in patients 1, 2, and 3 were day nine, 15, and five of illness, respectively. Patient 4 had three episodes of bradycardia, starting on day 10 of illness. Patients’ bradycardia episodes lasted one to 14 days. During bradycardia, maximum body temperatures ranged between 99.9 and 100.2 degree Fahrenheit. Patients 2, 3, and 4 required vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure > 65 mmHg during episodes. All four patients were on propofol at some point during bradycardia with patients 1, 2, and 3 also receiving dexmedetomidine. There was no consistent correlation of these medications with bradycardia. Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings included sinus bradycardia. Prolonged QTc interval observed in patient 2 on admission improved during bradycardia. Transient sinus bradycardia is a possible manifestation of COVID-19 and is important for close CV surveillance. Etiology can be multifactorial, but severe hypoxia, inflammatory damage of cardiac pacemaker cells, and exaggerated response to medications are possible triggers. High levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines may act directly on the sinoatrial (SA) node contributing to the development of bradycardia. This may be a warning sign of the onset of a serious cytokine storm. An increased awareness of possible exaggerated bradycardia response is important to consider with the use of empiric medications which have arrhythmogenic effects.",2020-06-13,"Amaratunga, Eluwana A; Corwin, Douglas S; Moran, Lynn; Snyder, Richard",Cureus,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/46f5c9ffa7eb4f5ed9e50e38d77662de42d33d21.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7294893.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32550090/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8599,219708993.0

Our study aimed to quantify the impact of COVID‐19 on the short‐term survival of cancer patients by comparing a period of 4 months after the outbreak began (2 March 2020) with an equal period from 2019. All cancer cases of the esophagus, stomach, colon and rectum, pancreas, lung, skin‐melanoma, breast, cervix, and prostate, from the Portuguese Oncology Institute of Porto (IPO‐Porto) and diagnosed between 2 March and 1 July of 2019 (before COVID‐19) and 2020 (after COVID‐19) were identified. Information regarding sociodemographic, clinical and treatment characteristics were collected from the cancer registry database and clinical files.

In particular, we model the interplay between the government and the population as a principal–agent problem with moral hazard, à la Cvitanić et al. (Finance Stoch 22(1):1–37, 2018), while an epidemic is spreading according to dynamics given by compartmental stochastic SIS or SIR models, as proposed respectively by Gray et al. (SIAM J Appl Math 71(3):876–902, 2011) and Tornatore et al. (Phys A Stat Mech Appl 354(15):111–126, 2005). More precisely, to limit the spread of a virus, the population can decrease the transmission rate of the disease by reducing interactions between individuals. However, this effort—which cannot be perfectly monitored by the government—comes at social and monetary cost for the population. To mitigate this cost, and thus encourage the lockdown of the population, the government can put in place an incentive policy, in the form of a tax or subsidy. In addition, the government may also implement a testing policy in order to know more precisely the spread of the epidemic within the country, and to isolate infected individuals. In terms of technical results, we demonstrate the optimal form of the tax, indexed on the proportion of infected individuals, as well as the optimal effort of the population, namely the transmission rate chosen in response to this tax. The government’s optimisation problems then boils down to solving an Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation. Numerical results confirm that if a tax policy is implemented, the population is encouraged to significantly reduce its interactions. If the government also adjusts its testing policy, less effort is required on the population side, individuals can interact almost as usual, and the epidemic is largely contained by the targeted isolation of positively-tested individuals.",2022-04-10,"Hubert, Emma; Mastrolia, Thibaut; Possamaï, Dylan; Warin, Xavier",J Math Biol,,,2009.00484,document_parses/pdf_json/249d162f2f4f9411f6ffd4cdd303555feab5d5a9.json; document_parses/pdf_json/e6455e1d121afbcfbf8e12efee7f8af38225e26b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8995008.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00285-022-01736-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35397720/; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.00484v2.pdf,221397106.0

fkfj410q,,PMC; WHO,777 Prehospital ECG in patients with acute myocardial infarction during the COVID-19 pandemic,10.1093/eurheartj/suab135.027,PMC8689750,,no-cc,"AIMS: Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) represents the preferred revascularization strategy among patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). A decline in the rates of primary PCI has been observed globally during the outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Fear of exposure to in-hospital infection has been hypothesized as the main mechanism of this phenomenon, also contributing to a delayed presentation of patients with STEMI. However, a formal assessment of initial electrocardiograms (ECGs) among STEMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic is still lacking. We therefore compared pre-hospital ECGs of STEMI patients hospitalized in Italy after the first reported case of COVID-19 on 21 February 2020 with data from the same period in 2019 to identifying potential changes between the two periods. METHODS AND RESULTS: Prehospital ECGs were obtained from the STEMI care network in the Campania region. Deidentified ECGs were analysed by two expert reviewers who were blinded to date of recording. Pathological Q-waves were defined as a Q-wave with a duration ≥40 ms and/or depth ≥25% of the R-wave in the same lead or the presence of a Q-wave equivalent. These criteria have been shown to be associated with final infarct size at cardiac magnetic resonance. For all conventional STEMI, the timing of STEMI onset was estimated with the Anderson-Wilkins (AW) acuteness score, ranging from 1 (least acute) to 4 (most acute). From 21 February 2020 to 16 April 2020, a total of 3239 pre-hospital ECGs were recorded by the emergency medical system and 167 (5.15%) were classified as STEMI. During the same period in 2019, 3505 pre-hospital ECGs were recorded, and 196 (5.59%) were classified as STEMI. There was no difference between the two study periods in terms of age, gender, type, and location of STEMI (Table 1). Pathological Q-waves were present in 54.5% of ECGs recorded during the COVID-19 period compared with 22.1% of ECGs recorded in the same period in 2019 (risk difference 32.3, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 21.2–43.5 percentage points). There was also an increase in the mean number of Q-waves during the COVID-19 compared with the control period (1.4 vs. 0.9; P < 0.001). These findings remained similar when QS- and qR complexes were analysed separately. Consistently, the AW score was significantly lower during the COVID-19 period (2.4 vs. 2.8; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Prehospital ECGs of STEMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic presented more frequently with signs of late ischemia compared with the equivalent period in 2019. Approximately, one out of two patients had already pathological Q-waves in the initial ECG. The AW acuteness score is superior to patient history (historical timing) in predicting myocardial salvage and mortality after reperfusion in STEMI patients, thus explaining the higher mortality rate and the increased risk of infarct-related complications observed during the COVID-19 pandemic.",2021-12-08,"Leone, Attilio; Avvedimento, Marisa; Angellotti, Domenico; Simonetti, Fiorenzo; Iapicca, Cristina; Verde, Nicola; Manzi, Lina; Canonico, Mario Enrico; Spinelli, Alessandra; Franzone, Anna; Piccolo, Raffaele; Esposito, Giovanni",Eur Heart J Suppl,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/suab135.027,245103804.0

Due to the non-availability of a vaccine against the disease, non-pharmaceutical interventions constitute major preventive and control measures. However, inadequate knowledge about the disease and poor perception might limit compliance. This study examined COVID-19-related knowledge, practices, perceptions and associated factors amongst undergraduate veterinary medical students in Nigeria. A cross-sectional web survey was employed to collect data from 437 consenting respondents using pre-tested self-administered questionnaire (August 2020). Demographic factors associated with the knowledge and adoption of recommended preventive practices towards COVID-19 were explored using multivariate logistic regression at P &#8804; 0.05.

Factors associated with the outbreak and lockdown can exacerbate CHF. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed the answers of 124 randomly selected CHF outpatients (mean age 71.0 ± 14.0 years, 60.5% male) interviewed by phone during the sixth and seventh weeks of the lockdown. Most patients were treated for New York Heart Association class II (38.7%) and reduced ejection fraction HF (70.2%). Psychological distress (Kessler 6 score ≥ 5) was common (18.5%), and 21.8% felt worse than before the lockdown. Few patients (n = 10) adjusted their intake of HF medications, always on medical prescription. Decreased physical activity was common (41.9%) and more frequent in women (P = 0.025) and urban dwellers (P = 0.009). Almost half of respondents (46.0%) declared increased screen time, but only few declared more alcohol intake (4.0%). Weight gain was common (27.4%), and 44.4% of current smokers increased tobacco consumption. Adherence to recommended salt or fluid intake restrictions was reduced in 14.5%. Increase in HF symptoms was commonly reported (21.8%) and tended to be higher in women than in men (P = 0.074). Of the 23 patients who had a phone teleconsultation during the pandemic, 16 had initially planned an in‐person consultation that they switched for teleconsultation. CONCLUSIONS: During the lockdown, psychological distress and decreased well‐being were common in CHF outpatients, and there was an increase in unhealthy lifestyle behaviours. These changes may negatively impact short‐term and long‐term prognoses.

Here we present a pivotal molecular mechanism of viral protein translation that relies on the mitochondrial translation machinery. We found that rare codons such as Leu-TTA are highly enriched in many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and these codons are essential for the regulation of viral protein expression. SARS-CoV-2 controls the translation of its spike gene by hijacking host mitochondria through 5’ leader and 3’UTR sequences that contain mitochondrial localization signals and activate the EGR1 pathway. Mitochondrial-targeted drugs such as lonidamine and polydatin significantly repress rare codon-driven gene expression and viral replication.

One surprisingly effective platform for healthcare professionals (HCPs) to share knowledge and experiences from the front lines has been social media (for example, the""#medtwitter""community on Twitter). However, identifying clinically-relevant content in social media without manual labeling is a challenge because of the sheer volume of irrelevant data. We present an unsupervised, iterative approach to mine clinically relevant information from social media data, which begins by heuristically filtering for HCP-authored texts and incorporates topic modeling and concept extraction with MetaMap. This approach identifies granular topics and tweets with high clinical relevance from a set of about 52 million COVID-19-related tweets from January to mid-June 2020. We also show that because the technique does not require manual labeling, it can be used to identify emerging topics on a week-to-week basis.

Training and education are important to ensure and sustain the safe and effective use of PPE by medical interns, but current methods are often inadequate in providing the relevant knowledge and skills. The purpose of this study was to explore medical graduates’ experiences of the use of PPE and identify opportunities for improvement in education and training programmes, to improve occupational and patient safety. METHODS: This study was undertaken in 2018 in a large tertiary-care teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia, to explore medical interns’ self-reported experiences of PPE use, at the beginning of their internship. Reflexive groups were conducted immediately after theoretical and practical PPE training, during hospital orientation. Transcripts of recorded discussions were analysed, using a thematic approach that drew on the COM-B (capability, opportunity, motivation - behaviour) framework for behaviour. RESULTS: 80% of 90 eligible graduates participated. Many interns had not previously received formal training in the specific skills required for optimal PPE use and had developed potentially unsafe habits. Their experiences as medical students in clinical areas contrasted sharply with recommended practice taught at hospital orientation and impacted on their ability to cultivate correct PPE use.

Participants were asked to pursue a target moving at a constant velocity. The target was either a 'standard' target, with a uniform color intensity, or a 'noisy' target, with blurry edges, to mimic the blurriness of an amblyopic eye. Analysis of pursuit patterns showed that the onset was delayed, and the gain was decreased in control children with a noisy target in comparison to amblyopic or control children with a standard target. Furthermore, a significant effect of prior and visual information on pursuit velocity and saccades was found across all participants. Moreover, the modulation of the effect of visual information on the pursuit velocity by group, that is amblyopes or controls with a standard target, and controls with a noisy target, was more limited in children. In other words, the effect of visual information was higher in control adults with a standard target compared to control children with the same target.

The psychopathological consequences of the pandemic and quarantine were anticipated to be of particular relevance, especially in patients with psychiatric disorders such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Aim of the present report was to describe the impact of COVID-19 pandemics within a sample of Italian patients affected by OCD. Sociodemographic and clinical variables of a sample of 123 OCD outpatients, currently attending three OCD tertiary clinics in Northern Italy, were assessed through telephone and in-person interviews. Patients showing a clinical worsening of OCD represented more than one third of the sample and reported a significant emergence of new obsessions and compulsions phenotypes along with a significant exacerbation of past ones.

79hhcw6n,,WHO,Mitoquinone mesylate targets SARS-CoV-2 and associated lung inflammation through host pathways,,,,unk,"To date, there is no effective oral antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 that is also anti-inflammatory. Herein, we show that the mitochondrial antioxidant mitoquinone/mitoquinol mesylate (Mito-MES), a dietary supplement, has potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants of concern in vitro and in vivo. Mito-MES had nanomolar in vitro antiviral potency against the Beta and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as the murine hepatitis virus (MHV-A59). Mito-MES given in SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-hACE2 mice through oral gavage reduced viral titer by nearly 4 log units relative to the vehicle group. We found in vitro that the antiviral effect of Mito-MES is attributable to its hydrophobic dTPP+ moiety and its combined effects scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), activating Nrf2 and increasing the host defense proteins TOM70 and MX1. Mito-MES was efficacious reducing increase in cleaved caspase-3 and inflammation induced by SARS-CoV2 infection both in lung epithelial cells and a transgenic mouse model of COVID-19. Mito-MES reduced production of IL-6 by SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelial cells through its antioxidant properties (Nrf2 agonist, coenzyme Q10 moiety) and the dTPP moiety. Given established safety of Mito-MES in humans, our results suggest that Mito-MES may represent a rapidly applicable therapeutic strategy that can be added in the therapeutic arsenal against COVID-19. Its potential long-term use by humans as diet supplement could help control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, especially in the setting of rapidly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants that may compromise vaccine efficacy.

There has been little literature thus far on the utility of screening ultrasound and the role of the clinical pharmacist in treating these patients. METHODS: We present a prospective pilot program of thirty-one consecutive COVID-19 patients who were provided four extremity screening ultrasounds for VTE on admission. This was coordinated by a clinical pharmacist as part of a multidisciplinary approach. Quantitative and qualitative data were recorded with the goal of describing the utility of the clinical pharmacist in ultrasound screening. Data collected include demographics, information on clinical symptoms or signs at presentation, and laboratory and radiologic results during the hospitalization from each individual electronic medical record. RESULTS: Nine of the thirty-one patients presented with VTE. Of the nine patients, there were twenty-two total clotted vessels, all of which were asymptomatic. The clinical pharmacist, as the coordinator for a multidisciplinary COVID-19 associated coagulopathy management team, drafted a screening and treatment protocol for anticoagulation prophylaxis and therapy of VTE after ultrasound findings.

Consequences may be more evident in patients with diabetes. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to identify the peculiarities of patients with DM among those in whom ICP were cancelled or postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to identify subgroups in which the influence of DM has higher impact on the clinical outcome. METHODS: We included 2,158 patients in whom an elective ICP was cancelled or postponed during COVID-19 pandemic in 37 hospitals in Spain. Among them, 700 (32.4%) were diabetics. Patients with and without diabetes were compared. RESULTS: Patients with diabetes were older and had a higher prevalence of other cardiovascular risk factors, previous cardiovascular history and co-morbidities. Diabetics had a higher mortality (3.0% vs. 1.0%; p = 0.001) and cardiovascular mortality (1.9% vs. 0.4%; p = 0.001). Differences were especially important in patients with valvular heart disease (mortality 6.9% vs 1.7% [p < 0.001] and cardiovascular mortality 4.9% vs 0.9% [p = 0.002] in patients with and without diabetes, respectively). In the multivariable analysis, diabetes remained as an independent risk factor both for overall and cardiovascular mortality. No significant interaction was found with other clinical variables. CONCLUSION: Among patients in whom an elective invasive cardiac procedure is cancelled or postponed during COVID-19 pandemic, mortality and cardiovascular mortality is higher in patients with diabetes, irrespectively on other clinical conditions.

Areas covered: Using papers published in PubMed, a case is presented to consider beneficial microbes as a means to improve management of infectious diseases. Clinical evidence is mounting that certain probiotic microbes can contribute to this armamentarium. These could have an immediate effect against necrotizing enterocolitis, pre- and post-surgical procedures, antibiotic-associated infections, urogenital infections in women and for reducing the severity and duration of respiratory infections. While further studies will always be warranted irrespective of the intervention, and quality assurance and patient safety must remain a priority, the main barrier to implementation may well be unwarranted hesitation amongst physicians, healthcare administrators and regulators. Meanwhile, patients are already taking things into their own hands at a time when their knowledge of product selection is poor and clinical guidance is invariably missing.

Invasive infections, including infective endocarditis, appear to be increasing in incidence. To date, preventive efforts have focused on modifying individual-level risk behaviours (eg, hand-washing and skin-cleaning) without much success in reducing the population-level impact of these infections. Learning from successes in HIV prevention, there may be great value in looking beyond individual-level risk behaviours to the social determinants of health. Specifically, the risk environment conceptual framework identifies how social, physical, economic and political environmental factors facilitate and constrain individual behaviour, and therefore influence health outcomes. Understanding the social and structural determinants of injecting-related bacterial and fungal infections could help to identify new targets for prevention efforts in the face of increasing incidence of severe disease. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a protocol for a systematic review. We will review studies of PWID and investigate associations between risk factors (both individual-level and social/structural-level) and the incidence of hospitalisation or death due to injecting-related bacterial infections (skin and soft-tissue infections, bacteraemia, infective endocarditis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, epidural abscess and others). We will include quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods studies. Using directed content analysis, we will code risk factors for these infection-related outcomes according to their contributions to the risk environment in type (social, physical, economic or political) and level (microenvironmental or macroenvironmental). We will also code and present risk factors at each stage in the process of drug acquisition, preparation, injection, superficial infection care, severe infection care or hospitalisation, and outcomes after infection or hospital discharge. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As an analysis of the published literature, no ethics approval is required. The findings will inform a research agenda to develop and implement social/structural interventions aimed at reducing the burden of disease.

Key figures, across the entire BBI-JU project portfolio (2014–2020) are provided, including expansion into biomass feedstocks, terrestrial and aquatic, and an impressive broadening of bio-based product portfolio, including higher-value, health-promoting products for man, animal, plants and soil. Parallel to this, diversification of industrial segments and types of funding instruments developed, reflecting industrial needs and academic research involvement. Impact assessment is highlighted. A number of specific recommendations are given; e.g., including international win/win CBE-collaborations, as e.g., expanding African EU collaboration into CBE.

Reallocation of resources for managing the outbreak might have caused a disruption in stroke care. This study analyses the impact on stroke care of reorganising the healthcare system in response to the first COVID-19 outbreak peak in Spain and the strategies adopted by Spanish stroke units to deal with this impact. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained data from a structured survey sent to the responsible of stroke units across the country. We recorded the number of strokes, stroke code activations, intravenous thrombolysis treatments and mechanical thrombectomies during February and March 2019 and 2020. We also collected information on the impact on workflow metrics and on the availability of specialised neurological care and rehabilitation treatments, the characteristics of stroke care for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact on human resources. We compared the activity data between 2019 and 2020 and the information on activity and impact on stroke care between regions classified according to the disease incidence rate. RESULTS: Fifty-seven (75%) of all stroke units in Spain responded to the survey. There was an overall reduction in admissions for all stroke types during the outbreak’s peak and in the number of stroke code activations and intravenous thrombolysis treatments, results that were independent of the COVID-19 incidence rate. Participants reported a delay in workflow metrics and a reduction of admissions to stroke units, outpatient clinics and rehabilitation therapies.

Evidence of Social and Economic Impact from a Natural Experiment in Ridesharing (preprint),10.2139/ssrn.3957981,,,unk,"By late 2021, only a fraction of the world’s population had been vaccinated for COVID-19. Governments and firms have invested billions of dollars to urge people to get vaccinated quickly so that economies can remain open. While public health experts have proposed several communication strategies to encourage vaccination, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of such campaigns, especially when undertaken by the private sector. Furthermore, firms may be hesitant to encourage their customers to vaccinate if they view such initiatives as a pro-social investment with no immediate positive effect on revenues. Using a natural experiment with a ridesharing platform, we find evidence that sharing information about vaccination can have a positive impact on both vaccination rates and firm revenues. Without providing financial incentives such as discounts or promotions, a simple ‘nudge’ can generate demand (trips) as well as motivate a socially beneficial action (getting vaccinated) by providing relevant and timely information (closest vaccine centers, appointment requirements, etc.). Analyzing more than four million customer trips, we found that providing COVID-19 vaccination information led to ~ 60% increase in trips to vaccine centers and an 7.67% increase in ridesharing usage among customers, generating 167 thousand dollars per week in additional revenues for the firm in the focal city. The increases in trips to vaccine centers and in revenues were likely driven by reduced search costs for customers and an increased number of trips taken by customers once fully vaccinated.",2021,"Choudhary, Vivek Liu Zhaoyan Kireyev Pavel Turki Selim Borzdyko Olesya Boutaib Abderrahmane",,,#ppcovidwho-292120,,,,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3957981,244052858.0

Serious complications include pneumonia, and mortality ranges from 2 to 5%. Until March 26, the World Health Organization reports 462 684 confirmed cases and 20 834 deaths worldwide. Dissemination occurs from aerosols or respiratory droplets. Different scientific societies have published clinical practice guidelines regarding ophthalmic care in the COVID-19 pandemic, but the information is presented inconsistently, which makes decision-making difficult. Methods: We conducted a sensitive bibliographic search in EMBASE and ophthalmic society webpages, of the clinical practice guidelines of ophthalmic care in pandemic COVID-19. We extracted the recommendations, organizing them into three categories: ""Which patients to attend"", ""How should the clinic work"", and ""What interventions should be avoided"". For each guideline, we assessed whether the search was systematic and whether the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was followed. Results: Fourteen relevant articles were found. Fifty-one recommendations were extracted and are shown in a summary table. None are based on a systematic search for evidence, nor do any use GRADE to develop the recommendations. Conclusions: The clinical practice guidelines that we reviewed all recommend rescheduling all non-urgent consultations and surgeries, reinforcing contact precautions, the use of personal protection elements, and the disinfection of surfaces and instruments. The guidelines should be improved by incorporating systematic searches for evidence, using GRADE for recommendations, and Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) for reporting.",2020,"Vargas-Peirano, Manuel; Navarrete, Pamela; Díaz, Traccy; Iglesias, Gabriel; Hoehmann, Martin",Medwave,,#32469854,,,,,219103883.0

In this study, we examined megalocytivirus-induced RNA responses in the spleen of flounder by high-throughput sequencing and integrative analysis of various RNA-seq data. A total of 1327 microRNAs (miRNAs), including 368 novel miRNAs, were identified, among which, 171 (named DEmiRs) exhibited significantly differential expressions during viral infection in a time-dependent manner. For these DEmiRs, 805 differentially expressed target mRNAs (DETmRs) were predicted, whose expressions not only significantly changed after megalocytivirus infection but were also negatively correlated with their paired DEmiRs. Integrative analysis of immune-related DETmRs and their target DEmiRs identified 12 hub DEmiRs, which, together with their corresponding DETmRs, formed an interaction network containing 84 pairs of DEmiR and DETmR. In addition to DETmRs, 19 DEmiRs were also found to regulate six key immune genes (mRNAs) differentially expressed during megalocytivirus infection, and together they formed a network consisting of 21 interactive miRNA-messenger RNA (mRNA) pairs. Further analysis identified 9434 circular RNAs (circRNAs), 169 of which (named DEcircRs) showed time-specific and significantly altered expressions during megalocytivirus infection. Integrated analysis of the DETmR-DEmiR and DEcircR-DEmiR interactions led to the identification of a group of competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) constituted by interacting triplets of circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA involved in antiviral immunity.

The influent wastewater of three major water reclamation facilities (WRFs) in Northern Nevada, serving a population of 390,750, was monitored for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA gene markers, N1 and N2, from June 2020 through September 2021. A total of 614 samples were collected and analyzed. The SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater were observed to peak twice during the study period. A moderate correlation trend between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence data from clinical testing and SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA concentrations in wastewater was observed (Spearman r = 0.533). This correlation improved when using weekly average SARS-CoV-2 marker concentrations of wastewater and clinical case data (Spearman r = 0.790), presumably by mitigating the inherent variability of the environmental dataset and the effects of clinical testing artifacts (e.g., reporting lags). The research also demonstrated the value of wastewater-based surveillance as an early warning signal for early detection of trends in COVID-19 incidence. This was accomplished by identifying that the reported clinical cases had a stronger correlation to SARS-CoV-2 wastewater monitoring data when they were estimated to lag 7-days behind the wastewater data. The results aided local decision makers in developing strategies to manage COVID-19 in the region and provide a framework for how wastewater-based surveillance can be applied across localities to enhance the public health monitoring of the ongoing pandemic.",2022-04-15,"Li, Lin; Mazurowski, Lauren; Dewan, Aimee; Carine, Madeline; Haak, Laura; Guarin, Tatiana C.; Dastjerdi, Niloufar Gharoon; Gerrity, Daniel; Mentzer, Casey; Pagilla, Krishna R.",Sci Total Environ,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/9131a121f94a2a843d2990d4dbdb1986866c2796.json; document_parses/pdf_json/fbca8dd1ec854014a61ca389744e53cd18d8f1a0.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8743272.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004896972200047X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972200047X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.152958; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35016937/,245829025.0

African traditional medicine has been in existence for several thousands of years, and several drugs have been discovered and developed from it. MAIN TEXT: The deadly coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 has widely spread globally with high mortality and morbidity. Its prevention, treatment and management still pose a serious challenge. A drug for the cure of this disease is yet to be developed. The clinical management at present is based on symptomatic treatment as presented by individuals infected and this is by combination of more than two drugs such as antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic, and anti-microbials. Literature search was performed through electronic searches of PubMed, Google Scholar, and several research reports including WHO technical documents and monographs. CONCLUSION: Drug discovery from herbs is essential and should be exploited for the discovery of drugs for the management of COVID-19.

8o1inbae,,WHO,Decreased prealbumin level is associated with increased risk for mortality in elderly hospitalized patients with COVID-19,,,,unk,"OBJECTIVES: High-risk patients &#8805;65 y of age with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) tended to have lower serum prealbumin concentrations. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of prealbumin at baseline on COVID-19-related mortality in elderly patients (&#8805;65 y of age). METHODS: We non-selectively and consecutively collected participants from Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January 17 to February 17, 2020. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were employed to evaluate the correlation between prealbumin and in-hospital outcomes (in-hospital mortality, admission to the intensive care unit [ICU], and mechanical ventilation) in elderly patients with COVID-19. Linear trend was performed by entering the median value of each category of prealbumin tertile as a continuous variable and was visually confirmed by using generalized additive models. Interaction and stratified analyses were conducted as well. RESULTS: We included 446 elderly patients with COVID-19 in the final analyses. In-hospital mortality was 14.79%. Of the 446 patients, 15.47% were admitted to the ICU and 21.3% required mechanical ventilation. Compared with patients in the highest tertile, the prealbumin of patients in the lowest tertile had a 19.09-fold higher risk for death [odds ratio (OR), 20.09; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.62-111.64; P = 0.0006], 25.39-fold higher risk for ICU admission (OR, 26.39; 95% CI, 4.04-172.39; P = 0.0006), and 1.8-fold higher risk for mechanical ventilation (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.15-6.78; P = 0.0227) after adjustment for potential confounders. There was a linear trend correlation between serum prealbumin concentration and risk for in-hospital mortality, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation in elderly patients with COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: Prealbumin is an independent risk factor of in-hospital mortality for elderly patients with COVID-19.

Accurate ED patient arrival forecasts can serve as a management baseline to better allocate ED personnel and medical resources. We combined calendar and meteorological information and used ten modern machine learning methods to forecast patient arrivals. For daily patient arrival forecasting, two feature selection methods are proposed. One uses kernel principal component analysis(KPCA) to reduce the dimensionality of all of the features, and the other is to use the maximal information coefficient(MIC) method to select the features related to the daily data first and then perform KPCA dimensionality reduction. The current study focuses on a public hospital ED in Hefei, China. We used the data November 1, 2019 to August 31, 2020 for model training; and patient arrival data September 1, 2020 to November 31, 2020 for model validation. The results show that for hourly patient arrival forecasting, each machine learning model has better forecasting results than the traditional autoRegressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, especially long short-term memory (LSTM) model. For daily patient arrival forecasting, the feature selection method based on MIC-KPCA has a better forecasting effect, and the simpler models are better than the ensemble models.

However, accidents owing to the erroneous programing of infusion pumps caused by users have been consistently reported in several documents. In this study, the authors propose a novel surveillance technique for infusion pumps to continuously monitor the variations in panel digits using a convolutional neural network model, and evaluate the performance of the implemented technique. During the experimental evaluation, 1st-step ROIs and 2nd-step ROIs were successfully extracted from the frame images regardless of the ambient lighting conditions. The final accuracies of the implemented CNN model are 99.9% for both the training (172,800 images) and validation (1080 images) dataset while the final losses for the training and validation datasets are 0.48 and 0.45 after 13th epoch, respectively. In the 24-h continuous monitoring test, the accuracy of the model for volume recognition considering all the 1440 measurements (960 for day-lighting and 480 for night-lighting) is 95.5%, whereas in day-lighting and night-lighting modes the accuracies of the model are 98.2% and 90.0%, respectively.

utlr7ohc,,WHO,DCcov: Repositioning of Drugs and Drug Combinations for SARS-CoV-2 Infected Lung through Constraint-Based Modelling,,,,unk,"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) became a worldwide pandemic with currently no effective antiviral drug except treatments for symptomatic therapy. Flux balance analysis is an efficient method to analyze metabolic networks. It allows optimizing for a metabolic function and thus e.g., predicting the growth rate of a specific cell or the production rate of a metabolite of interest. Here flux balance analysis was applied on human lung cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to reposition metabolic drugs and drug combinations against the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus within the host tissue. Making use of expression data sets of infected lung tissue, genome-scale COVID-19-specific metabolic models were reconstructed. Then host-specific essential genes and gene-pairs were determined through in-silico knockouts that permit reducing the viral biomass production without affecting the host biomass. Key pathways that are associated with COVID-19 severity in lung tissue are related to oxidative stress, as well as ferroptosis, sphingolipid metabolism, cysteine metabolism, and fat digestion. By in-silico screening of FDA approved drugs on the putative disease-specific essential genes and gene-pairs, 45 drugs and 99 drug combinations were predicted as promising candidates for COVID-19 focused drug repositioning (https://github.com/sysbiolux/DCcov). Among the 45 drug candidates, six antiviral drugs were found and seven drugs that are being tested in clinical trials against COVID-19. Other drugs like gemcitabine, rosuvastatin and acetylcysteine, and drug combinations like azathioprine-pemetrexed might offer new chances for treating COVID-19.",2021,"Kishk, Ali Pacheco Maria Pires Sauter Thomas",,,#ppcovidwho-314263,,,,,232352830.0

llw1jbec,,WHO,Saving lives by ventilating two patients with specific pressure-controlled ventilation from a single ICU-ventilator during the COVID-19 pandemic,,,,unk,"In late December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 was discovered, which is responsible for a new human disease called COVID-19. Among all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, 14% were hospitalized, with 2% admitted to intensive care units (ICU) with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation [1]. SARS-CoV-2 has spread quickly across the world, with more than one hundred million confirmed cases and more than 2,500,000 dead. In March 2020, the Hospital of Valenciennes had to admit hundreds of COVID-19 patients, and its capacity was almost exceeded [2]. More recently, in France, thousands of critically ill patients had to be admitted to ICUs. In Europe, the next wave of COVID-19 pandemic could be more severe than the first one, and we already know that, in the case of increasing numbers of critically ill, some of them will die as a result of the unavailability of mechanical ventilators [3]. This shortage may be lessened if one ventilator could service more than one patient. The main worry is that this concept could be not useful and systematically deleterious for the patient. Some concepts have already been proposed to ventilate differently two circuits with a single ventilator, with several limitations like the lack of individualization of ventilation of each circuit [4-6]. More recently, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, Clarke et al. [7] described a new concept able to deliver specific ventilation for two different lung tests with a single ventilator. Again, Levin et al. [8] have recently shown that a similar concept of differential ventilation using a single ventilator with flow control valves is feasible in humans.",2021,"Hureau, Maxence; Versyck, Maaike; Fontainre, Sylvie; Lambiotte, Fabien; El Beki, Nabil; Saint Leger, Piehr",Anaesthesiol.

Several lung ultrasound (US) protocols for pneumonia diagnosis are used in clinical practice, but none has been proposed for COVID-19 patients' screening in the emergency department. We adopted a simplified 6-scan lung US protocol for COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis (LUSCOP) and compared its sensitivity with high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in patients suspected for COVID-19, presenting to one Emergency Department from February 21st to March 15th, 2020, during the outbreak burst in northern Italy. Patients were retrospectively enrolled if both LUSCOP protocol and HRCT were performed in the Emergency Department. The sensitivity of LUSCOP protocol and HRCT were compared. COVID-19 pneumonia's final diagnosis was based on real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction from nasal-pharyngeal swab and on clinical data. Out of 150 suspected COVID-19 patients, 131 were included in the study, and 130 had a final diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The most frequent lung ultrasonographic features were: bilateral B-pattern in 101 patients (77%), B-pattern with subpleural consolidations in 26 (19.8%) and lung consolidations in 2 (1.5%). LUSCOP Protocol was consistent with HRCT in correctly screening 130 out of the 131 COVID-19 pneumonia cases (99.2%). In one case COVID-19 pneumonia was excluded by both HRCT and lung US.

RESULTS Data were identified from searches of MEDLINE, Current Contents, PubMed and from references in relevant articles from January 1987 to 15th of September 2021. We carry out an updated systematic review involving 5862 patients initially selected for fertility-sparing surgery in 275 series. FINDINGS In patients having a stage IB1 disease, recurrence rate/RR in patients undergoing simple conisation/trachelectomy, radical trachelectomy/RT by laparoscopico-vaginal approach, laparotomic or laparoscopic approaches are respectively: 4.1%, 4.7%, 2.4% and 5.2%. In patients having a stage IB2 disease, RR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or RT by laparotomy are respectively 13.2% and 4.8% (p = .0035).

Children are particularly under-represented in registry research. This paper lays out novel principles, methods and governance to integrate diverse registries within or alongside a planned children’s mega-cohort to rapidly generate translatable evidence. GenV (Generation Victoria) will approach for recruitment parents of all newborns (estimated 150,000) over two years from mid-2021 in the state of Victoria (population 6.5 million), Australia. Its sample size and population denominator mean it will contain almost all children with uncommon or co-morbid conditions as they emerge over time.

Diabetes is the most common cause of diabetic nephropathy, which is attributed to hyperglycemia. COVID-19 produces severe complications in people with diabetes mellitus. This article explains how SARS-CoV-2 causes more significant kidney damage in diabetic patients. Importantly, COVID-19 and diabetes share inflammatory pathways of disease progression. SARS-CoV-2 binding with ACE-2 causes depletion of ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) from blood vessels, and subsequently, angiotensin-II interacts with angiotensin receptor-1 from vascular membranes that produce NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen phosphate) oxidase, oxidative stress, and constriction of blood vessels. Since diabetes and COVID-19 can create oxidative stress, we hypothesize that COVID-19 with comorbidities such as diabetes can synergistically increase oxidative stress leading to end-stage renal failure and death. Antioxidants may therefore prevent renal damage-induced death by inhibiting oxidative damage and thus can help protect people from COVID-19 related comorbidities. A few clinical trials indicated how effective the antioxidant therapy is against improving COVID-19 symptoms, based on a limited number of patients who experienced COVID-19. In this review, we tried to understand how effective antioxidants (such as vitamin D and flavonoids) can act as food supplements or therapeutics against COVID-19 with diabetes as comorbidity based on recently available clinical, preclinical, or in silico studies.",2022-01-13,"Paul, Alok K.; Hossain, Md K.; Mahboob, Tooba; Nissapatorn, Veeranoot; Wilairatana, Polrat; Jahan, Rownak; Jannat, Khoshnur; Bondhon, Tohmina A.; Hasan, Anamul; de Lourdes Pereira, Maria; Rahmatullah, Mohammed",Nutrients,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/c2a9f5b870132cf974a6d48e7178ca62e6c4003b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8780958.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35057501/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14020321,245977676.0

There is currently no marker of IS that can be used to predict vaccination responses. Here, we study if torque tenovirus (TTV) can be used as a predictive marker. Methods The humoral response to the mRNA-1273 vaccine was assessed in 103 LTR, who were vaccinated 4 to 237 months after Lung transplantation. Spike (S)-specific IgG levels were measured at baseline, 28 days after first, and 28 days after the second vaccination. TTV loads were determined by RT-PCR and Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated to correlate serological responses to TTV load. Results Humoral responses to the vaccine COVID-19 vaccination were found in 41/103 (40%) LTR at 28 days after the second vaccination. 62 /103 (60%) had no detectable antibodies. TTV loads at baseline correlated with S-specific antibodies and the percentage of responders (=<0.001) (Fig 1). TTV loads also strongly correlated with the time since transplantation, indicating that participants with lower TTV loads were longer after transplantation. Conclusion This study shows an association between baseline TTV load and mRNA-1273-induced S-specific antibodies. If the TTV load is indeed a predictor of vaccination responses, this can be used in the future as a potential guidance for optimizing vaccination regimens. Therefore, we recommend that TTV load measurements are included in further vaccination efficacy studies in immunocompromised cohorts.",2022-04-30,"Verschuuren, E. A.; Hoek, R.; de Vries, R.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 51 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients (37 men, 14 women) with a mean age of 51.94±13 years, and 51 controls (30 men, 21 women) with a mean age, 49.31±15 years were included in this study in a retrospective fashion. All computed tomographic (CT) images were evaluated by two neuroradiologists. Sclerosis of pterygoid plate and other findings included pterygoid plate erosion, adjacent tumor enhancement, and parapharyngeal extension which were assessed. MRI findings were also recorded. The prevalence of pterygoid plate sclerosis was compared using Chi-square statistical tests. Imaging findings were analyzed by binary logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The prevalence of pterygoid plate sclerosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma was 53.9% compared to the control group (16.7%) and the difference was statistically significant (P-value< 0.001). In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the prevalence of tumor adjacent to the pterygoid plate, parapharyngeal extension and pterygoid plate erosion were 69.6%, 81.4%, 38.2%, respectively. No erosion of pterygoid plate was detected in the control group. The odds of adjacent tumor enhancement and pterygoid plate erosion was 7.29 and 20.56 times higher in the sclerotic pterygoid plate (p-values of 0.019 and 0.000, respectively). MRI was available for four nasopharyngeal carcinoma cases with five sclerotic pterygoid plates, where two showed enhancements. All non-sclerotic pterygoid plates showed no enhancement on MRI.

The HUVECs were treated with S.juice and fermented S.juice for 18 h before LPS exposure, and the levels of cytokines and chemokines, such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Furthermore, to examine the changes in inflammatory responses to the two treatments, immunofluorescence analysis was used to visualize the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Western blot analysis was also performed to detect the differences in the expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules, specifically vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Both S.juice and fermented S.juice inhibited the LPS-induced expression of MCP-1 and IL-6, and suppressed VCAM-1 and ICAM-1.

Inferring the intentional states of our interaction partners is crucial in achieving this, and social neuroscience has begun elucidating the intra- and inter-personal neural processes supporting such inferences. Typically, however, neuroscientific paradigms lack the reciprocal to-and-fro characteristic of social communication, offering little insight into the way these processes operate online during real-world interaction. In the present study, we overcame this by developing a ""hyperscanning"" paradigm in which pairs of interactants could communicate verbally with one another in a joint-action task whilst both undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging simultaneously. Successful performance on this task required both interlocutors to predict their partner's upcoming utterance in order to converge on the same word as each other over recursive exchanges, based only on one another's prior verbal expressions. By applying various levels of analysis to behavioural and neuroimaging data acquired from 20 dyads, three principle findings emerged: First, interlocutors converged frequently within the same semantic space, suggesting that mutual understanding had been established. Second, assessing the brain responses of each interlocutor as they planned their upcoming utterances on the basis of their co-player's previous word revealed the engagement of the temporo-parietal junctional (TPJ), precuneus and dorso-lateral pre-frontal cortex. Moreover, responses in the precuneus were modulated positively by the degree of semantic convergence achieved on each round.

The portal is a health technology tool that was developed with a mainstream, English-speaking audience in mind. Thus, there are valid concerns that such technologies will actually exacerbate health care disparities, conferring further advantages to the already advantaged. In this paper, we describe a framework for portal engagement (awareness, registration, and use) among safety net patients. We incorporate the experiences in the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services to illustrate important contextual factors for portal outreach in our safety net.

The fatigue outcomes derive from the software Sleep, Activity, Fatigue, and Task Effectiveness Fatigue Avoidance Scheduling Tool (SAFTE-FAST). The average minimum SAFTE-FAST effectiveness during critical phases of flight decreases cubically with the number of shifts that elapse totally or partially between mid-night and 6 a.m. within a 30-day period ($N_{NS}$). As a consequence, the relative fatigue risk increases by 23.3% (95% CI, 20.4-26.2%) when increasing $N_{NS}$ from 1 to 13. The average maximum equivalent wakefulness in critical phases also increases cubically with the number of night shifts and exceeds 24 hours for rosters with $N_{NS}$ above 10. The average fatigue hazard area in critical phases of flight varies quadratically with the number of departures and landings within 2 and 6 a.m. ($N_{Wocl}$). These findings demonstrate that both $N_{NS}$ and $ N_{Wocl}$ should be considered as key performance indicators and be kept as low as reasonably practical when building aircrew rosters. The effectiveness scores at 30 minute time intervals allowed a model estimate for the relative fatigue risk as a function of the time of the day, whose averaged values show reasonable qualitative agreement with previous measurements of pilot errors. Tailored analyses of the SAFTE-FAST inputs for afternoon naps before night shifts, commuting from home to station and vice-versa, and bedtime before early-start shifts show relevant group effects ($p<0.001$) comparing the groups with and without afternoon naps, with one or two hours of commuting and with or without the advanced bedtime feature of the SAFTE-FAST software, evidencing the need of a better and more accurate understanding of these parameters when modelling fatigue risk factors.",2022-01-14,"Rodrigues, Tulio E.; Fischer, Frida M.; Helene, Otaviano; Antunes, Eduardo; Furlan, Eduardo; Morteo, Eduardo; Menquini, Alfredo; Lisboa, Joao; Frank, Arnaldo; Simoes, Alexandre; Papazian, Karla; Helene, Andr'e F.",,,,2201.05438,document_parses/pdf_json/aad7a01535da422edb86195fe40264b87d29368e.json,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05438v2.pdf,245986360.0

However, according to estimates in different countries, agriculture has suffered less than other sectors such as construction, industry and tourism, so agricultural development can be a good option to compensate for the economic damage caused to other sectors. The quality of available water and soil resources for agricultural development is not only limited, but is also decreasing incrementally, so the use of saline and unconventional soil and water resources is inevitable. Biosaline agriculture or haloculture is a system in which highly saline water and soil resources are used sustainably for the economic production of agricultural crops. It seems that in the current situation of the world (with COVID-19's impact on agriculture on the one hand and the quantitative and qualitative decline of freshwater and soil on the other), haloculture with a re-reading of territorial capabilities has good potential to provide a part of human food supply. In this review article, the potential of haloculture to offset the adverse impacts of the pandemic is analyzed from five perspectives: increasing the area under cultivation, using unconventional water, stabilizing dust centers, increasing the body's immune resistance, and reducing losses in agribusiness due to the coronavirus.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries adopted restrictive measures to mitigate infection spread, which might have influenced people's lifestyle and dietary habits. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the impact of stay-at home orders' implementation on adherence to MD. METHODS: Studies were identified searching Medline, Embase, and Web Of Science, the search strategy was developed using a combination of free text and mesh terms referring to COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown, and MD. Studies published until March 31st, 2021 were included. We only considered studies reporting original data from quantitative analysis and assessing modifications of adherence to the MD through validated dietary scores or any change in consumption of food categories that are typically ascribed to the MD. Data extraction, pooling and quality appraisal of the included studies, were conducted applying PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: 42 studies were retrieved. After duplicates removal, and in-blind two-step screening, 10 studies met our a priori defined inclusion criteria and were included in the review. 71.4% of the studies reporting a rate of change in adherence, measured through validated questionnaire both before and during lockdown, reported an increase, while 28.6% reported no significative changes. All included studies reporting the percentage of participants having a high adherence to the MD, based on their results on MEDAS questionnaire, before and during the lockdown, found an increase in this percentage. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to the MD could have raised in people undergoing lockdowns due to COVID-19. KEY MESSAGES: The impact of restrictive measures on determinants of health must be monitored.

Owing to uncertainties and crisis amid the pandemic, as an emergency announcement, the World Health Organization (WHO) solicits the help of health authorities, especially, researchers to conduct in-depth research on the evolution and treatment of COVID-19. This paper proposes an integer-valued time series model to analyze the series of COVID-19 cases in Mauritius wherein the corresponding innovation term accommodates for covariate specification. In this set-up, sanitary curfew followed by sanitization and sensitization campaigns, time factor and safe shopping guidelines have been tested as the most significant variables, unlike climatic conditions. The over-dispersion estimates and the serial auto-correlation parameter are also statistically significant. This study also confirms the presence of some unobservable effects like the pathological genesis of the novel coronavirus and environmental factors which contribute to rapid propagation of the zoonotic virus in the community. Based on the proposed COM-Poisson mixture models, we could predict the number of COVID-19 cases in Mauritius. The forecasting results provide satisfactory mean squared errors.

While some transitioned to virtual formats, others disappeared, offering fewer opportunities for trainees to share research. Facing this challenge, the Association of Women Surgeons developed a novel approach. Designed to promote greater global inclusion, increase audience engagement and opportunities for networking and feedback from practicing surgeons, they restructured their annual trainee research symposium as a virtual, multi-round competition. APPROACH: Submission to the research competition was open to trainees at any level. The competition comprised four rounds: (1) visual abstracts (all welcomed), (2) three-minute “Quickshot” presentation (32 advance), (3) eight-minute oral presentations (16 advance), and (4) final question-and-answer style defense (final 4 compete). Progression through the first three rounds was determined by public voting. Winners were determined by live voting during the final session. OUTCOMES: A total of 73 visual abstracts were accepted for presentation. Fifty-six percent (n = 41) of first authors were medical students, 36% residents (n = 26), and 7% fellows (n = 6). Five were from international first authors (7%). Abstracts represented research topics including basic science (n = 6, 8%)), clinical outcomes (n = 38, 52%), and education (n = 29, 40%). Social media impressions exceeded a total of 30,000 views. NEXT STEPS: This virtual, multi-round research competition served as a blueprint for a novel approach to research dissemination.

The aim of the present study is to undertake a joint evaluation of hs-Troponin and natriuretic peptides (NP) in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: In this multicenter observational study, we analyzed data from n = 111 patients. Cardiac biomarkers subgroups were identified according to values beyond reference range. RESULTS: Increased hs-Troponin and NP were found in 38 and 56% of the cases, respectively. As compared to those with normal cardiac biomarkers, these patients were older, had higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and had more severe COVID-19 pneumonia by higher CRP and d-dimer and lower PaO2/FIO2. Two-dimensional echocardiography performed in a subset of patients (n = 24) showed significantly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with elevated NP (p = 0.02), whereas right ventricular systolic function (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion) was significantly reduced both in patients with high hs-Troponin and NP (p = 0.022 and p = 0.03, respectively). Both hs-Troponin and NP were higher in patients with in-hospital mortality (p = 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). On multivariable analysis, independent associations were found of hs-Troponin with age, PaO2/FIO2 and d-dimer (B = 0.419, p = 0.001; B = − 0.212, p = 0.013; and B = 0.179, p = 0.037, respectively) and of NP with age and previous CVD (B = 0.480, p < 0.001; and B = 0.253, p = 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial involvement at admission is common in COVID-19 pneumonia. Independent associations of hs-Troponin with markers of disease severity and of NP with underlying CVD might point toward existing different mechanisms leading to their elevation in this setting.

The aim of this study was to assess the added value of p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the homogeneity within a group of dedicated gastrointestinal (GI) pathologists. METHODS AND RESULTS Sixty-single haematoxylin and eosin (HE) slide referral BO cases [20 low-grade dysplasia (LGD); 20 high-grade dysplasia (HGD); and 20 non-dysplastic BO reference cases] were digitalised and independently assessed twice in random order by 10 dedicated GI pathologists. After a 'wash-out' period, cases were reassessed with the addition of a corresponding p53 IHC slide. Outcomes were: (i) proportion of 'indefinite for dysplasia' (IND) diagnoses; (ii) interobserver agreement; and (iii) diagnostic accuracy as compared with a consensus 'gold standard' diagnosis defined at an earlier stage by five core expert BO pathologists after their assessment of this case set. Addition of p53 IHC decreased the mean proportion of IND diagnoses from 10 of 60 to eight of 60 (P = 0.071). Mean interobserver agreement increased significantly from 0.45 to 0.57 (P = 0.0021). The mean diagnostic accuracy increased significantly from 72% to 82% (P = 0.0072) after p53 IHC addition. CONCLUSION Addition of p53 IHC significantly improves the histological assessment of BO biopsies, even within a group of dedicated GI pathologists.

This study aimed to (i) assess the time trend in the usage of amalgam and composite in posterior teeth at Griffith University Dental Clinic from 2010 to 2019; (ii) to test whether this trend varied according to the dental health provider. METHODS We analyzed clinic records from 2010 to 2019. Prais-Winsten analyses were performed, and the average annual percentages change (AAPC) for amalgam and composite was estimated. RESULTS There were 397,013 procedures, including 80,995 direct posterior restorations. Amalgam use decreased from 12.9% in 2010 to 0.5% in 2019 among students, while composite use has increased from 87.1% to 99.5% of posterior restorations. The annual increase of composite was 1.4% per year for students, while amalgam decreased by 30.2% per year on average. A similar trend was noted among the dentists. CONCLUSIONS A significant decrease in the use of amalgam was observed over time for both students and professionals. This trend raises questions about curriculum reviews, focusing on the repair, maintenance, and safe removal of amalgam while reinforcing the learning on Minimally Invasive Dentistry and composite restorations based on the patient's caries risk.",2020-11-16,"Reher, Vanessa; Reher, Peter; Peres, Karen G; Peres, Marco A",Australian dental journal,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/adj.12807; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197295/,226986814.0

We aim to investigate the clinical characteristic and allergy status of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS Electronical medical records including demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data and radiological materials of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection were extracted and analysed. RESULTS An approximately 1:1 ratio of male (50.7%) and female COVID-19 patients was found, with an overall median age of 57.0 years. All patients were community acquired cases. Fever (91.7%), cough (75.0%), fatigue (75.0%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (39.6%) were the most common clinical manifestations, whereas hypertension (30.0%) and diabetes mellitus (12.1%) were the most common comorbidities. Drug hypersensitivity (11.4%) and urticaria (1.4%) were self-reported by several patients. Asthma or other allergic diseases was not reported by any of the patients. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 1.4%) and current smokers (1.4%) were rare. Bilateral ground glass or patchy opacity (89.6%) were the most common signs of radiological finding. Lymphopenia (75.4%) and eosinopenia (52.9%) were observed in most patients. Blood eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe (r=0.486, p<0.001) and non-severe (r=0.469, p<0.001) patients after hospital admission. Significantly higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were associated with severe patients compared to non-severe patients (all p<0.001). CONCLUSION Detailed clinical investigation of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 cases suggest eosinopenia together with lymphopenia may be a potential indicator for diagnosis.

The association of the virus spread from the market is supported by the close relation of genome sequences of environmental surface samples with virus samples from earliest patients by phylogenetic analysis. Objectives To have an insight into the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences reported from India for better understanding on their epidemiology and virulence. Methods Genome sequences of Indian isolates of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed to understand their phylogeny and divergence with respect to other isolates reported from other countries. Amino acid sequences of individual open reading frames (ORFs) from SARS-CoV-2 Indian isolates were aligned with sequences of isolates reported from other countries to identify the mutations occurred in Indian isolates. Results Our analysis suggests that Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates are closely related to isolates reported from other parts of the world. Most ORFs are highly conserved; mutations were also detected in some ORFs. We found that most isolates reported from India have key mutations at 614th position of the S protein and 84th position of the ORF 8, which has been reported to be associated with high virulence and high transmission rate. Conclusion An attempt was made to understand the SARS-CoV-2 virus reported from India. SARS-CoV-2 reported from India was closely similar to other SARS-CoV-2 reported from other parts of the world, which suggests that vaccines and other therapeutic methods generated from other countries might work well in India.

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective study. ANIMALS Twelve client-owned cats with ureteral urolithiasis treated with ureteroneocystostomy. METHODS Records were reviewed for signalment, location of the obstruction, diagnostic tests, surgical technique, perioperative complications, long-term measurements of kidney function, and survival. Cats were divided into two groups; in one group, a DPT was placed at the time of ureteroneocystostomy, and, in the other group, a DPT was not placed at the time of ureteroneocystostomy (NDPT). RESULTS A DPT was placed in six of 12 cats. The NDPT group included four cats with temporary catheters and two cats with no catheter. Median creatinine concentration decreased from 10.4 mg/dL (range, 1.6-20.3) to 2.2 mg/dL (range, 1.1-3.6) at the time of discharge (P = .015) in all cats. Two cats in the NDPT group required revision surgery for uroabdomen. Eleven cats were discharged from the hospital. Long-term complications (hematuria, pollakiuria, urinary tract infections) were more common in the DPT group (P = .047). Seven cats were alive a median of 329 days (range, 8-1772) after surgery. Median creatinine concentration was 2.0 mg/dL (range, 0.6-6.4) at a median of 157 days (range, 43-1772) after surgery. CONCLUSION Ureteroneocystostomy resulted in acceptable long-term outcomes in 11 of 12 cats. The placement of a DPT did not influence the long-term outcome in this small population.

Growing evidence indicates that COVID-19 frequently causes coagulopathy, presenting as hypercoagulation and incidental thrombosis. For these reasons, a multifactorial approach with several anticoagulant markers should be considered in the management of anticoagulation using heparin in COVID-19 patients on V-V ECMO. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 48-year-old man was infected with COVID-19 with a worsening condition manifesting as acute respiratory distress syndrome. DIAGNOSES: He was refractory to conventional therapy, thus we decided to introduce V-V ECMO. We used heparin as an anticoagulant therapy for V-V ECMO and adjusted the doses of heparin by careful monitoring of the activated clotting time (ACT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) to avoid both hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications. We controlled the doses of heparin in the therapeutic ranges of ACT and APTT, but clinical hemorrhaging and profound elevation of coagulant marker became apparent. INTERVENTIONS: Using thromboelastography (TEG; Haemonetics) in addition to ACT and APTT, we were able to clearly detect not only sufficient coagulability of COVID19 on V-V ECMO (citrated rapid thromboelastography-R 0.5 min, angle 75.5°, MA 64.0 mm, citrated functional fibrinogen-MA 20.7 mm) but also an excessive effect of heparin (citrated kaolin -R 42.7 min, citrated kaolin with heparinase 11.7 min). OUTCOMES: Given the TEG findings indicating an excessive heparin effect, the early withdrawal of ECMO was considered. After an evaluation of the patient's respiratory capacity, withdrawal from V-V ECMO was achieved and then anticoagulation was stopped. The hemorrhagic complications and elevated thrombotic marker levels dramatically decreased. LESSONS: TEG monitoring might be a useful option for managing anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients on V-V ECMO frequently showing a hypercoagulative state and requiring massive doses of heparin, to reduce both hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications.",2021-06-11,"Nakashima, Ryosuke; Nishihara, Masaaki; Iyonaga, Takeshi; Iwasaka, Sho; Yamamoto, Yuzo; Shono, Yuji; Maki, Jun; Tokuda, Kentaro; Akahoshi, Tomohiko; Higo, Taiki; Kitazono, Takanari; Tsutsui, Hiroyuki",Medicine (Baltimore),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e3b4c06bec8e9ce4b79c34dfc82acfa37dae9503.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8202565.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000026313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34115042/,235403455.0

The PRRSV-specific humoral immune response has been dismissed as being ineffective and perhaps deleterious for the host. The function of PRRSV antibodies in protective immunity against infection with a highly abortifacient strain of this virus was examined by passive transfer experiments in pregnant swine. All of a group of pregnant gilts (n = 6) that received PRRSV immunoglobulin (Ig) from PRRSV-convalescent, hyperimmune animals were fully protected from reproductive failure as judged by 95% viability of offspring at weaning (15 days of age). On the other hand, the totality of animals in a matched control group (n = 6) receiving anti-pseudorabies virus (PRV) Ig exhibited marked reproductive failure with 4% survival at weaning. Besides protecting the pregnant females from clinical reproductive disease, the passive transfer of PRRSV Ig prevented the challenge virus from infecting the dams and precluded its vertical transmission, as evidenced by the complete absence of infectious PRRSV from the tissues of the dams and lack of infection in their offspring. In summary, these results indicate that PRRSV-Igs are capable of conferring protective immunity against PRRSV and furthermore that these Igs can provide sterilizing immunity in vivo.",2002,"Osorio, F A; Galeota, J A; Nelson, E; Brodersen, B; Doster, A; Wills, R; Zuckermann, F; Laegreid, W W",Virology,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12429512/,17653408.0

At the same time, many are sceptical about the real impact of these reforms, fearing that they are triggering a paradoxical financialisation of sustainability. Building on recent research on institutional logics and institutional fields formation, we examine changes in the EU regulatory dynamics as characterised by shifts in framing the relationship between sustainability and finance. Deploying a longitudinal approach (2009–2019), consisting of archival data and semi-structured interviews, we explore the development of EU sustainable finance regulation as an extended, interactive and contested process. Specifically, we suggest that regulatory dynamics depend on the hybrid configuration of the social constituencies supporting sustainable finance reforms and on shifts in the overall prevalence of the financial logic in society.

However, the function of PLP1 remains unclear. In this study, we found that overexpression of PLP1 significantly promoted PEDV replication and inhibited production of interferon-ß. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry were used to identify cellular interaction partners of PLP1. Host cell poly(C) binding protein 2 (PCBP2) was determined to bind and interact with PLP1. Both endogenous and overexpressed PCBP2 co-localized with PLP1 in the cytoplasm. Overexpression of PLP1 upregulated expression of PCBP2. Furthermore, overexpression of PCBP2 promoted PEDV replication. Silencing of endogenous PCBP2 using small interfering RNAs attenuated PEDV replication.

The goals of this study were to identify actions and policies regarding COVID-19 that healthcare organizations can implement to promote POS and to evaluate the impact of POS on physicians' mental health, burnout, and intention to leave patient care. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional national survey with an online panel of internal medicine physicians from the American College of Physicians in September and October of 2020. POS was measured with a 4-item scale, based on items from Eisenberger's Perceived Organizational Support Scale that were adapted for the pandemic. Mental health outcomes and burnout were measured with short screening scales. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The response rate was 37.8% (N = 810). Three healthcare organization actions and policies were independently associated with higher levels of POS in a multiple linear regression model that included all actions and policies as well as potential confounding factors: opportunities to discuss ethical issues related to COVID-19 (ß (regression coefficient) = 0.74, p = .001), adequate access to personal protective equipment (ß = 1.00, p = .005), and leadership that listens to healthcare worker concerns regarding COVID-19 (ß = 3.58, p < .001). Sanctioning workers who speak out on COVID-19 safety issues or refuse pandemic deployment was associated with lower POS (ß = -2.06, p < .001). In multivariable logistic regression models, high POS was associated with approximately half the odds of screening positive for generalized anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, burnout, and intention to leave patient care within 5 years. APPLICATIONS TO PRACTICE: Our results suggest that healthcare organizations may be able to increase POS among physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic by guaranteeing adequate personal protective equipment, making sure that leaders listen to concerns about COVID-19, and offering opportunities to discuss ethical concerns related to caring for patients with COVID-19. Other policies and actions such as rapid COVID-19 tests may be implemented for the safety of staff and patients, but the policies and actions associated with POS in multivariable models in this study are likely to have the largest positive impact on POS. Warning or sanctioning workers who refuse pandemic deployment or speak up about worker and patient safety is associated with lower POS and should be avoided. We also found that high degrees of POS are associated with lower rates of adverse outcomes. So, by implementing the tangible support policies positively associated with POS and avoiding punitive ones, healthcare organizations may be able to reduce adverse mental health outcomes and attrition among their physicians.",2022,"Sonis, Jeffrey; Pathman, Donald E; Read, Susan; Gaynes, Bradley N; Canter, Courtney; Curran, Patrick; Jones, Cheryl B; Miller, Thomas",J Healthc Manag,,#covidwho-1840099,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35576445/; https://doi.org/10.1097/jhm-d-21-00208,248702023.0

Although the community-wide implementation of basic non-pharmaceutical intervention measures, such as social distancing, quarantine of suspected COVID-19 cases, isolation of confirmed cases, use of face masks in public, contact tracing and testing, have been quite effective in curtailing and mitigating the burden of the pandemic, it is universally believed that the use of a vaccine may be necessary to effectively curtail and eliminating COVID-19 in human populations. This study is based on the use of a mathematical model for assessing the impact of a hypothetical imperfect anti-COVID-19 vaccine on the control of COVID-19 in the United States. An analytical expression for the minimum percentage of unvaccinated susceptible individuals needed to be vaccinated in order to achieve vaccine-induced community herd immunity is derived. The epidemiological consequence of the herd immunity threshold is that the disease can be effectively controlled or eliminated if the minimum herd immunity threshold is achieved in the community. Simulations of the model, using baseline parameter values obtained from fitting the model with COVID-19 mortality data for the U.S., show that, for an anti-COVID-19 vaccine with an assumed protective efficacy of 80%, at least 82% of the susceptible US population need to be vaccinated to achieve the herd immunity threshold. The prospect of COVID-19 elimination in the US, using the hypothetical vaccine, is greatly enhanced if the vaccination program is combined with other interventions, such as face mask usage and/or social distancing. Such combination of strategies significantly reduces the level of the vaccine-induced herd immunity threshold needed to eliminate the pandemic in the US. For instance, the herd immunity threshold decreases to 72% if half of the US population regularly wears face masks in public (the threshold decreases to 46% if everyone wears a face mask).",2020-08-06,"Iboi, Enahoro; Ngonghala, Calistus N.; Gumel, Abba B.",Infect Dis Model,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/52db9dc237108da7f8f288ee28455097e8dd3cf8.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7409819.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042720300300?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468042720300300; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32835142/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.07.006,221011785.0

These disparities pose a critical ethical challenge in developing fair triage systems that will maximize lives saved without perpetuating systemic inequities. Here we review alternatives to 'utilitarian' triage, including first-come first-served, egalitarian, and prioritarian systems of allocating scarce medical resources.

We previously reported findings from a double-blind, multicentre, randomised, controlled phase 1 trial on the safety and immunogenicity of three different formulations of BBV152 (3 µg with Algel-IMDG, 6 µg with Algel-IMDG, or 6 µg with Algel) and one Algel-only control (no antigen), with the first dose administered on day 0 and the second dose on day 14. The 3 µg and 6 µg with Algel-IMDG formulations were selected for this phase 2 study. Herein, we report interim findings of the phase 2 trial on the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152, with the first dose administered on day 0 and the second dose on day 28. METHODS: We did a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152 in healthy adults and adolescents (aged 12-65 years) at nine hospitals in India. Participants with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and serology tests were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 3 µg with Algel-IMDG or 6 µg with Algel-IMDG. Block randomisation was done by use of an interactive web response system. Participants, investigators, study coordinators, study-related personnel, and the sponsor were masked to treatment group allocation. Two intramuscular doses of vaccine were administered on day 0 and day 28. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 wild-type neutralising antibody titres and seroconversion rates (defined as a post-vaccination titre that was at least four-fold higher than the baseline titre) at 4 weeks after the second dose (day 56), measured by use of the plaque-reduction neutralisation test (PRNT50) and the microneutralisation test (MNT50). The primary outcome was assessed in all participants who had received both doses of the vaccine. Cell-mediated responses were a secondary outcome and were assessed by T-helper-1 (Th1)/Th2 profiling at 2 weeks after the second dose (day 42). Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of the vaccine. In addition, we report immunogenicity results from a follow-up blood draw collected from phase 1 trial participants at 3 months after they received the second dose (day 104). This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04471519. FINDINGS: Between Sept 5 and 12, 2020, 921 participants were screened, of whom 380 were enrolled and randomly assigned to the 3 µg with Algel-IMDG group (n=190) or 6 µg with Algel-IMDG group (n=190). Geometric mean titres (GMTs; PRNT50) at day 56 were significantly higher in the 6 µg with Algel-IMDG group (197·0 [95% CI 155·6-249·4]) than the 3 µg with Algel-IMDG group (100·9 [74·1-137·4]; p=0·0041). Seroconversion based on PRNT50 at day 56 was reported in 171 (92·9% [95% CI 88·2-96·2] of 184 participants in the 3 µg with Algel-IMDG group and 174 (98·3% [95·1-99·6]) of 177 participants in the 6 µg with Algel-IMDG group. GMTs (MNT50) at day 56 were 92·5 (95% CI 77·7-110·2) in the 3 µg with Algel-IMDG group and 160·1 (135·8-188·8) in the 6 µg with Algel-IMDG group. Seroconversion based on MNT50 at day 56 was reported in 162 (88·0% [95% CI 82·4-92·3]) of 184 participants in the 3 µg with Algel-IMDG group and 171 (96·6% [92·8-98·8]) of 177 participants in the 6 µg with Algel-IMDG group. The 3 µg with Algel-IMDG and 6 µg with Algel-IMDG formulations elicited T-cell responses that were biased to a Th1 phenotype at day 42. No significant difference in the proportion of participants who had a solicited local or systemic adverse reaction in the 3 µg with Algel-IMDG group (38 [20·0%; 95% CI 14·7-26·5] of 190) and the 6 µg with Algel-IMDG group (40 [21·1%; 15·5-27·5] of 190) was observed on days 0-7 and days 28-35; no serious adverse events were reported in the study. From the phase 1 trial, 3-month post-second-dose GMTs (MNT50) were 39·9 (95% CI 32·0-49·9) in the 3µg with Algel-IMDG group, 69·5 (53·7-89·9) in the 6 µg with Algel-IMDG group, 53·3 (40·1-71·0) in the 6 µg with Algel group, and 20·7 (14·5-29·5) in the Algel alone group. INTERPRETATION: In the phase 1 trial, BBV152 induced high neutralising antibody responses that remained elevated in all participants at 3 months after the second vaccination. In the phase 2 trial, BBV152 showed better reactogenicity and safety outcomes, and enhanced humoral and cell-mediated immune responses compared with the phase 1 trial. The 6 µg with Algel-IMDG formulation has been selected for the phase 3 efficacy trial. FUNDING: Bharat Biotech International.

The uncertainties surrounding the pandemic have also led to multifaceted mental health concerns, which can be exacerbated with precautionary measures such as social distancing and self-quarantining, as well as societal impacts such as economic downturn and job loss. Despite noting this as a “mental health tsunami”, the psychological effects of the COVID-19 crisis remain unexplored at scale. Consequently, public health stakeholders are currently limited in identifying ways to provide timely and tailored support during these circumstances. OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to provide insights regarding people’s psychosocial concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic by leveraging social media data. We aim to study the temporal and linguistic changes in symptomatic mental health and support expressions in the pandemic context. METHODS: We obtained about 60 million Twitter streaming posts originating from the United States from March 24 to May 24, 2020, and compared these with about 40 million posts from a comparable period in 2019 to attribute the effect of COVID-19 on people’s social media self-disclosure. Using these data sets, we studied people’s self-disclosure on social media in terms of symptomatic mental health concerns and expressions of support. We employed transfer learning classifiers that identified the social media language indicative of mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, stress, and suicidal ideation) and support (emotional and informational support). We then examined the changes in psychosocial expressions over time and language, comparing the 2020 and 2019 data sets. RESULTS: We found that all of the examined psychosocial expressions have significantly increased during the COVID-19 crisis—mental health symptomatic expressions have increased by about 14%, and support expressions have increased by about 5%, both thematically related to COVID-19. We also observed a steady decline and eventual plateauing in these expressions during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have been due to habituation or due to supportive policy measures enacted during this period. Our language analyses highlighted that people express concerns that are specific to and contextually related to the COVID-19 crisis. CONCLUSIONS: We studied the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 crisis by using social media data from 2020, finding that people’s mental health symptomatic and support expressions significantly increased during the COVID-19 period as compared to similar data from 2019. However, this effect gradually lessened over time, suggesting that people adapted to the circumstances and their “new normal.” Our linguistic analyses revealed that people expressed mental health concerns regarding personal and professional challenges, health care and precautionary measures, and pandemic-related awareness.

STUDY DESIGN A case-control study: LS using tackers (n=35, tacker group) compared with LS using sutures (n=65, suture group). In addition to clinical evaluation of prolapse, all patients were evaluated for urinary incontinence (ICIQ-SF), dorsolumbar pain, overall quality of life (SF-36 score), and overall improvement in symptoms (PGI-I), one year after LS. RESULTS The patient characteristics (age, initial stage of prolapse,…) were comparable in the two groups, as was operating time (240 vs. 210min, p=0.18). There was no significant between-group difference in terms of anatomical correction (median post-operative ICS stage: 0 in both groups, p=0.26) or post-operative complication rates. The incidence of de novo low back pain appearing after LS was equivalent in both groups (50% vs. 25%, in the tacker and suture groups, respectively, p=0.11). However, there was a significant difference in lumbar pain intensity evaluated using the visual analog scale (4 (IQR 0-6.5) vs. 0 (IQR 0-4) in the tacker and suture groups, respectively; p=0.01), and in post-operative quality of life, which was better in patients in the suture group according to all the questionnaires.

a949ozhc,,WHO,Determinants of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine: A public survey primarily focused on the usa,,,,unk,"Rationale: A considerable number of US-based populations are reluctant to accept the potential COVID-19 vaccine. However, the socio-demographic determinants for vaccine acceptance are yet to be explored. We designed a population-based survey to estimate the probable predictors for acceptance of COVID-19 immunization. Methods: The study was conducted between June and November 2020. A public survey link was sent out via the Redcap using social media and websites like Studyfinder and Researchmatch. Dichotomous (yes/no) questions were framed to understand the new COVID vaccine's future acceptability. Five sociodemographic variables were considered as potential predictors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, including age, race, education level, healthcare workers, and COVID-19 hospitalization among the relatives. We used the Chisquare test to determine whether the predictors, as mentioned earlier, influenced the acceptance rates. Logistic regression was used to analyze the association between outcome(acceptance) vs. predictors and generate the rank list of significant predictors. Results: We received 1137 survey responses, including 19 'no response' to that primary question. Vaccine acceptance rates differed significantly among the groups categorized by age, race, and level of education, with χ2=17.63,p&lt;0.001∗ χ2= 35.87,p&lt;0.001∗ and χ2= 32.22,p&lt;0.001∗, respectively. Healthcare workers and COVID-19 hospitalization did not influence the vaccine acceptance rate. Participants belonging to the 'White' race had a higher acceptance rate than the participants who identified themselves as 'African-American' (83.6% vs. 63.5%;χ2= 22.80,p&lt;0.001∗). 'Middle age' group (group-III) (44-60 years) had the lowest acceptance rate (74.2%), while the oldest two groups ('61-70 years'(group-IV) and '&gt;70 years'(group-V)) had the highest acceptance rates (85.0% and 88.3% respectively). The differences among those age groups, as determined by Chi-square tests, were statistically significant (χ2=9.51,p=0.002 for group-III vs. group-IV and χ2= 11.54,p&lt;0.001∗ for group-III vs. group-V, respectively). Participants with 'High-school education' had a significantly lower level of approval (69.3%) rate vs. 'Masters' (88.2%) (χ2= 21.847,p&lt;0.001∗) and vs. 'Ph.D./Professionals' (89.9%) (χ2= 19.39,p&lt;0.001∗). The logistic regression model demonstrated an overall significance (χ2=67.38,p&lt;0.001∗). Level of education was ranked as the top predictor of vaccine acceptance, based on Wald χ2 (χ2=29.18,p&lt;0.0001), followed by age (χ2= 18.24,p=0.001∗) and race (χ2= 16.42,p=0.0009∗). Finally, the study participants who received the influenza vaccine in the previous years were more likely to get the COVID-19 vaccine (χ2=79.88,p&lt;0.001∗). Conclusions: People with a higher education level, white race, and old age are more likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccine. Level of education was the top predictor of acceptance of vaccination, based on the logistic regression model.",2021,"Mondal, P.; Sinharoy, A.; Su, L.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,#covidwho-1277105,,,,,242021385.0

We describe the clinical and virologic features of URIs that remain uncomplicated and those that precede an episode of sinusitis. We hypothesize that certain viruses are more likely to lead to acute sinusitis, and we compare viruses identified at the time of diagnosis of sinusitis with those identified early in the URI. METHODS: Children aged 48–96 months were followed longitudinally for 1 year. Nasal samples were obtained at surveillance visits, on Day 3–4 of the URI, and on Day 10, when sinusitis was diagnosed. Molecular diagnostic testing was performed on nasal washes for common respiratory viruses and pathogenic bacteria. A standardized score was used to quantify symptom severity. RESULTS: We evaluated 519 URIs, and 37 illnesses in 31 patients met the criteria for sinusitis. Respiratory syncytial virus was detected more frequently in URI visits that led to sinusitis, compared to in uncomplicated URIs (10.8% vs 3.4%; P = .05). New viruses were detected in 29% of sinusitis episodes, and their pattern was different than those patterns observed at surveillance. The median number of URIs per subject per year was 1 (range 0–9) in uncomplicated URI subjects and 3 (range 1–9) in sinusitis subjects (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Children who developed sinusitis experienced more frequent URIs, compared to children whose URIs remained uncomplicated. When nasal samples were obtained on the day of diagnosis of acute sinusitis, nearly 30% of children had a new virus identified, suggesting that some children deemed to have sinusitis were experiencing sequential viral infections.",2019-11-15,"DeMuri, Gregory P; Eickhoff, Jens C; Gern, James C; Wald, Ellen R",Clin Infect Dis,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e678b6aa4754217a96354c9731af1bd91fd9ef2e.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7108184.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108184/,
98a9fnw2,,WHO,Range of reproduction number estimates for COVID-19 spread,,,,unk,"To monitor local and global COVID-19 outbreaks, and to plan containment measures, accessible and comprehensible decision-making tools need to be based on the growth rates of new confirmed infections, hospitalization or case fatality rates. Growth rates of new cases form the empirical basis for estimates of a variety of reproduction numbers, dimensionless numbers whose value, when larger than unity, describes surging infections and generally worsening epidemiological conditions. Typically, these determinations rely on noisy or incomplete data gained over limited periods of time, and on many parameters to estimate. This paper examines how estimates from data and models of time-evolving reproduction numbers of national COVID-19 infection spread change by using different techniques and assumptions. Given the importance acquired by reproduction numbers as diagnostic tools, assessing their range of possible variations obtainable from the same epidemiological data is relevant. We compute control reproduction numbers from Swiss and Italian COVID-19 time series adopting both data convolution (renewal equation) and a SEIR-type model. Within these two paradigms we run a comparative analysis of the possible inferences obtained through approximations of the distributions typically used to describe serial intervals, generation, latency and incubation times, and the delays between onset of symptoms and notification. Our results suggest that estimates of reproduction numbers under these different assumptions may show significant temporal differences, while the actual variability range of computed values is rather small.",2020,"Pasetto, Damiano; Lemaitre, Joseph C; Bertuzzo, Enrico; Gatto, Marino; Rinaldo, Andrea",Biochem. biophys. res. commun,,#968628,,,,,227904724.0

We compared qRT-PCR analysis of formalin- and HOPE-fixed, paraffin-embedded lymph node tissues from Mycobacterium bovis-infected cattle by extracting total RNA using a commercial kit (Ambion) and a Trizol method. RNA extracted from HOPE-fixed tissues showed comparable quantities between the commercial kit (82.7-107.9 microg/ml total RNA) and the Trizol method (87-161.1 microg/ml total RNA), displaying a high degree of integrity when analyzed by electrophoresis. RNA extracted from formalin-fixed tissues using the commercial kit produced similar concentrations (80.6-145.7 microg/ml total RNA) in comparison to the HOPE tissue; however, the integrity was compromised. Extraction of RNA from the formalin-fixed tissues using Trizol was unsuccessful. Following qRT-PCR for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), total RNA from HOPE-fixed tissues showed higher levels of target messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) (4.05 x 10(-2)pg/100 ng total RNA using the commercial kit and 6.45 x 10(-2)pg/100 ng total RNA using Trizol) in comparison to formalin-fixed tissues (5.69 x 10(-4)pg/100 ng total RNA).

Interruptions in chest compressions are detrimental. We aimed to compare the effect of mouth-to-mouth ventilation (MMV), mouth-to-pocket mask ventilation (MPV) and bag-valve-mask ventilation (BMV) on the quality of CPR. MATERIALS AND METHODS Surf lifeguards in active service were included in the study. Each surf lifeguard was randomized to perform three sessions of single-rescuer CPR using each of the three ventilation techniques (MMV, MPV and BMV) separated by 5 min of rest. Data were obtained from a resuscitation manikin and video recordings. RESULTS A total of 60 surf lifeguards were included (67% male, 33% female, mean age 25 years). Interruptions in chest compressions were significantly reduced by MMV (8.9 ± 1.6 s) when compared to MPV (10.7 ± 3.0 s, P < 0.001) and BMV (12.5 ± 3.5s, P < 0.001). Significantly more effective ventilations (visible chest rise) were delivered using MMV (91%) when compared to MPV (79%, P < 0.001) and BMV (59%, P < 0.001). The inspiratory time was longer during MMV (0.7 ± 0.2 s) and MPV (0.7 ± 0.2s, P < 0.001 for both) compared to BMV (0.5 ± 0.2s). Tidal volumes were significantly lower using BMV (0.4 ± 0.2L) compared to MMV (0.6 ± 0.2L, P < 0.001) and MPV (0.6 ± 0.3 L, P < 0.001), whereas no differences were observed when comparing MMV and MPV. CONCLUSION MMV reduces interruptions in chest compressions and produces a higher proportion of effective ventilations during lifeguard CPR.

Each caregiver plays a critical role in the society, supporting the health and well-being of those who are ill, disabled, or older and who need frequent support. Digital technologies are becoming a ubiquitous part of everyday life for many, but little is known about the real-world impact of technology for those in a caring role, including the abilities of technologies to address the mental and physical impacts of caregiving. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the current and future technology use of caregivers, including digital technologies used to care for themselves and the person they look after. METHODS: We codeveloped a wide range of questions with caregivers and care professionals and delivered this survey both on the web and in paper format (eg, using social networks such as Twitter alongside in-person events). Questions were focused on providing care and looking after caregiver health and well-being. Analyses focused on both quantitative outcomes (frequency counts and Likert questions) and explored free text entries (thematic analysis). RESULTS: From 356 respondents, we identified that caregivers were receptive to, and largely positive about current and future use of technology both for their own care and their caring role (eg, checking in from distance). There were notable concerns, including the risk that technology could replace human contact. We identified several key areas for future work, including communication with health and social care professionals, and the potential for technology to help caregivers with their own health. We also identified several stakeholders (eg, care workers, pharmacy staff, and general practitioners) who could act as suitable points for technology signposting and support. CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers are a transient, often difficult to reach population, and this work has collated a large body of knowledge across a diverse group of individuals. Many caregivers, like the rest of society, are realizing the benefits of using everyday technology to help deliver care. It is clear that there is already a high level of dependency on technologies, where future expectations will grow. However, many barriers to digital technology use remain, including a lack of ongoing technology support. Preventive measures linked to technology that can help look after a caregiver’s own health appear acceptable, particularly for communicative tools. This collated caregiver knowledge is a call for all stakeholders—academics, policy makers, and practitioners—to take note of these specific challenges, and to ensure that caregiver voices are both heard and fully integrated within the emerging digital health agenda.",2022-01-27,"Egan, Kieren J; Clark, Patricia; Deen, Zahid; Paputa Dutu, Carmen; Wilson, Graham; McCann, Lisa; Lennon, Marilyn; Maguire, Roma",JMIR Aging,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/4287f9aebad61025173e8babb334692b9198eda8.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8832269.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.2196/15413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35084339/,246296151.0

A major concern for patients with penile cancer during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is how the enforced safety measures will affect their disease management. Delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation may have an impact on the extent of the primary lesion as well as the cancer-specific survival because of the development and progression of inguinal lymph node metastases.

Results were presented to an international panel of experts on penile cancer and infection control by a virtual accelerated Delphi process using 4 survey rounds. Consensus opinion was defined as an agreement of &#8805;80%, which was used to reconfigure management pathways for penile cancer. RESULTS: Limited evidence is available for delaying penile cancer management. The consensus rate of agreement was 100% that penile cancer pathways should be reconfigured, and measures should be developed to prevent perioperative nosocomial transmission of COVID-19.

Several studies focusing on the patient's perspective have illustrated that telemedicine is comparable to traditional office visits in terms of cost, communication, and overall satisfaction. However, there is sparse data on the provider's experience. METHODS: With IRB approval, we assessed provider satisfaction with telemedicine at Urology programs in the U.S. through an electronic survey. The 25-question survey was based on the Patient Assessment of Communication of Telehealth which is a validated 33 question instrument that has been utilized to assess the quality of patient-provider communication in telemedicine. Experience with telemedicine was assessed in 2 categories: technical aspects and communication with patients. Variables were rated using a 5-point Likert Scale. RESULTS: There were 144 responses to the survey. 50% of providers reported not receiving any formal training in using telemedicine. This differed significantly by training level with 55% of attendings having had received training vs 20% of residents. Providers felt they would most benefit from training in billing (52%) rather than equipment use (33%) or communication (28%). 87% of providers felt comfortable discussing sensitive topics while only 55% felt comfortable using telehealth to schedule surgery (P < .001).

vjxsiuuv,,WHO,Pandemic Spread-an Empirical Analysis,,,,unk,"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) epidemic started in late 2019, and was upgraded to a pandemic on March 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). Well established epidemiological models have been used over the last few months in an attempt to predict how the virus would spread. The predictions were frightening, and the resulting panic caused many governments to impose lockdowns or other severe restrictions, with lasting effects. This short paper discusses another way of looking at the spread of COVID-19, by focusing on the daily rate of infection, defined as the daily rate of increase in the number of infected persons. It is shown that the daily rate is monotonically decreasing, after a short initial period, in all countries, and that the pattern is similar in all countries. This appears to be a universal phenomenon. Based on these calculations, the April 1, 2020 data for Western Europe were sufficient to predict the beginning of the end of COVID-19 in that region before the end of that month.",2020,"Ziegler, Zvi",,,#647151,,,,,220530993.0

The relationships between virus infection and the mechanisms that moderate cytokine transcription are incompletely understood. We investigated the influence of Keap1 on cytokine gene induction by Sendai virus infection in mouse embryo fibroblasts. Virus infection induced Keap1 binding to the Ifnb1, Tnf, and Il6 genes. Keap1 moderated viral induction of their transcription by mechanisms that did not require Nrf2. Keap1 was required for NF-&#954;B p50 recruitment, but not for NF-&#954;B p65 or IRF3 recruitment, to these genes. Keap1 formed complexes with NF-&#954;B p50 and NF-&#954;B p65, which were visualized using bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis. These bimolecular fluorescence complementation complexes bound chromosomes in live cells, suggesting that Keap1 could bind chromatin in association with NF-&#954;B proteins. Keap1 was required for viral induction of G9a-GLP lysine methyltransferase binding and H3K9me2 modification at cytokine genes. G9a-GLP inhibitors counteracted transcription repression by Keap1 and enhanced Keap1 and NF-&#954;B recruitment to cytokine genes. The interrelationships among Keap1, NF-&#954;B, and G9a-GLP recruitment, activities, and transcriptional effects suggest that they form a feedback circuit, which moderates viral induction of cytokine transcription. Nrf2 counteracted Keap1 binding to cytokine genes and the recruitment of NF-&#954;B p50 and G9a-GLP by Keap1. Whereas Keap1 has been reported to influence cytokine expression indirectly through its functions in the cytoplasm, these findings provide evidence that Keap1 regulates cytokine transcription directly in the nucleus. Keap1 binds to cytokines genes upon virus infection and moderates their induction by recruiting NF-&#954;B p50 and G9a-GLP.",2021,"Burns, Veronica Elizabeth; Kerppola, Tom Klaus",J. immunol,,#mdl-34400522,,,,,237149725.0

r52cuj1o,,WHO,An Effect of US-China Rivalry on Latin America and Its Implication,10.2139/ssrn.3903729,,,unk,"English Abstract: Conflicts between the United States and China have been appearing in various forms across many regions;it can be seen in trade, commerce, politics, and diplomacy. In addition, it is likely that the conflicts between the two countries intensify as the multilateralism would be threatened and protectionism would emerge in the post-COVID 19 era. Latin America is not an exception to this issue of the US-China conflict. In terms of national security, the United States has only option to react sensitively to the growing influence of China in Latin America, considering the geographical proximity between the United States and Latin America. For this reason, varied conflicts between the United States and China occur in Latin America. This study nvestigated the patterns of US-China rivalry that appeared in Latin America and analyzed the effects of this rivalry on Latin American countries in multifaceted ways. In Chapter 2, we examined how the US and Chinese foreign policies against Latin America have changed. Furthermore, we summarized specific policies against Latin America that were implemented under the Trump administration. The fundamental goal of the US policy was to occupy a regional hegemony in Latin America by giving them incentive and pressure. In particular, the Trump administration tended to weigh on Latin America in many sectors such as immigration, infrastructure, and so on. By contrast, Chinese policies against Latin America aim at maintaining cooperative relations with Latin America in the absence of specifics. In Chapter 3, we presented several examples of the US-China conflict that were observed in Latin America. This conflict was mostly prominent in the infrastructure sector, in which the United States was likely to press Latin America in order to exclude China from related projects. In Chapter 4, we conducted an empirical analysis by focusing on the trade dispute between the United States and China that occurred in 2018. Specifically, we analyzed the impact of the retaliatory tariffs between the two countries on exports of major Latin America countries to United States and China. In addition, we complementarily examined the effect of the trade dispute on the welfare of the Latin American countries with the CGE (Computational General Equilibrium) model. As a result of the empirical analysis, Brazil’s export to China have increased significantly since the imposition of the tariffs, and then the effect has disappeared over time. In contrast, there was no consistent pattern for countries other than Brazil. The impact of the US-China conflict on the welfare of the countries in Latin America was trivial. The conflict between the United States and China that occurs in Latin America could be an opportunity for Korean companies that seek to advance into Latin America. The companies may be given an unintended chance as Latin America is faced by US pressure to rule out China from infrastructure sector. Therefore, it would be important to monitor the political position of Latin American countries in terms of seeking opportunities to enter Latin America in the future.",2021,"Hong, Sungwoo Yoon Yeo Joon Kim Jin- O.; Rim, Jeewoon Nam Jimin",,,#ppcovidwho-312497,,,,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3903729,237189905.0

Spain has been one of the most severely affected countries, and Madrid has reported a high number of cases and deaths. We discuss our strategies for optimal breast cancer management during COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study at Clínico San Carlos Hospital to analyze breast cancer patient management during the pandemic outbreak and surgical strategy after the pandemic outbreak. We created a practical and dynamic tool based on a ""traffic light"" system for prioritizing surgical time. Every patient was contacted by telephone with a preoperative COVID-19 protocol. After surgical procedures, patient satisfaction was assessed using EORTC IN-PATSAT32. RESULTS: Breast cancer patients actively treated with surgical procedures were put on a waiting list and received systemic therapy. Telemedicine was used to evaluate any side effects and to avoid unnecessary hospital visits. Surgery was only considered after the pandemic outbreak and then only those procedures designed to minimize surgical complications and therefore reduce hospital stay. We also measured patients´ satisfaction with medical and nursing scales that resulted “very good” evaluation tending to “excellent”. CONCLUSION: It is necessary to adapt the management of oncology treatment and the surgical strategy to optimize resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The main aim of this review is to highlight findings of cortical spreading depolarization (CSD)-induced neuroinflammatory signaling in brain parenchyma from the inflammasome perspective. In addition, we discuss the limited data of the contribution of inflammasomes to other aspects of migraine pathophysiology, foremost the activation of the trigeminovascular system and thereby the generation of migraine pain. MAIN BODY: Inflammasomes are signaling multiprotein complexes and key components of the innate immune system. Their activation causes the production of inflammatory cytokines that can stimulate trigeminal neurons and are thus relevant to the generation of migraine pain. The contribution of inflammasome activation to pain signaling has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Nucleotide-binding domain (NOD)-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) is the best characterized inflammasome and there is emerging evidence of its role in a variety of inflammatory pain conditions, including migraine. In this review, we discuss, from an inflammasome point of view, cortical spreading depolarization (CSD)-induced neuroinflammatory signaling in brain parenchyma, the connection with genetic factors that make the brain vulnerable to CSD, and the relation of the inflammasome with diseases that are co-morbid with migraine, including stroke, epilepsy, and the possible links with COVID-19 infection.

METHODS: A facility-based observational cross-sectional study was used to assess medication counseling practice by pharmacy professionals. Data were gathered through an observation and a semi-structured questionnaire. Epi data version 4.0.2 was used to enter data, which was subsequently exported to SPSS version 21.0 for analysis. ANOVA and post hoc statistical analyses were used to investigate the association between independent and dependent variables; and a 0.05 p-value was considered. RESULTS: This study has a total of 105 pharmacy professionals that were included in the analysis. The majority of those who responded were between the ages of 25 and 29.

In this paper, we examine the potential systemic impacts of these activities in the Global South, using the Multi-Level Perspective from literature on sustainability transitions. We conduct a longitudinal case study of a non-governmental organization that has been pioneering distributed manufacturing solutions in the Global South for almost a decade. We illustrate that the pandemic is a major landscape event that is having profound impacts on the existing socio-technical regime and niche levels. We show how niches mature over time, and that the pandemic has created an opportunity for niche replication and alignment. We present an initial analysis of factors that support and resist the path dependency of the existing regime. Thus, we speculate about the possibility to transition away from a development model predicated on the transfer of products from the North to the South, to an endogenous model of sustainable development that is underpinned by local design and production in the South. Here we show that crisis creates a key window of opportunity for sustainable development in the Global South through the formation of distributed manufacturing networks. © 2021 Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

wkbasoi9,,WHO,"The Call for Bilateral/Regional Trade Agreements and the Salient Features of the Anti-Dumping & Countervailing Duties Act, No. 2 of 2018 of Sri Lanka",10.2139/ssrn.3808022,,,unk,"COVID-19 has resulted in extraordinarily challenging times. The outbreak has disrupted the lives of people and is casting a heavy impact on the economies around the world by interrupting business operations and commercial activities. Whilst everyone is busy identifying various strategies from short term and medium to long term to overcome the recession, the future projects a blurry picture at least for the moment. A study group consisting of eminent persons recently submitted a report to the President containing recommendations aimed at steering Sri Lanka into a post-COVID-19 era of economic recovery. One of the recommendations was on Trade Agreements. The suggestion includes action to revive and accelerate the negotiation of a trade partnership agreement with China;an expanded agreement with India;an agreement with Thailand and with other Asian countries particularly other ASEAN members including Japan and to maximize the benefits from the Agreement already entered with Singapore.In this backdrop, the question arises as to whether the existing laws in Sri Lanka on Trade and Anti-Dumping are sufficient to protect the domestic traders and domestic industries against any possible unfair trading practices and the possibility of an unforeseen surge of imports which may arise with the signing of more Bilateral and Regional Trade Agreements. An attempt is made in this article to examine the key features and the effectiveness of the provisions of the legislation passed by the Parliament in 2018 on Anti-Dumping and to identify the protective measures that are sought to be introduced under the same.The Anti-Dumping & Countervailing Duties Act, No. 2 of 2018, and the Safeguard Measures Act, No. 3 of 2018 were certified by the Speaker of the Sri Lankan Parliament in March 2018. The enactment of these two laws was to remedy a need to answer the grievances of domestic producers and manufacturers. The official statement issued by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on the occasion stipulates that Sri Lanka has taken a fairly long time to introduce the relevant legislation. This article proceeds to consider some of the salient features of the Anti-Dumping & Countervailing Duties Act, No. 2 of 2018 (the Anti-Dumping Act of 2018 Act) namely: (1) Part I of the Anti-Duping Act of 2018 on Anti-Dumping Duties, (2) the procedural steps in investigations under Part I on Anti-Dumping (3) Part II of the Anti-Duping Act of 2018 Act on Countervailing Duties, and (4) the procedural steps in investigations under Part II on Countervailing Duties.The Anti-Dumping Act of 2018 contains significant noteworthy features. Firstly, the act attempts to strike a balance between competing interests. The Right to Information on one hand and the economic value of sensitive trade-related information on the other. Secondly, the Act specifies timeframes for inquiries and related procedural steps recognizing the importance of resolving trade-related disputes in an effective, efficient, and efficacious manner. Thirdly the Act lays down a systematic procedure that ensures a fair opportunity be given to all parties with provision for public interest intervention. In terms of methodology, this article strictly adopts a doctrinal approach;doctrinal since the article proceeds to engage in an analysis of the law as it is on the four areas identified above. The enactment of these two laws will significantly improve the country’s standing in global trade and Sri Lanka will join the league of World Trade Organization - WTO members who keenly look to offset possible adverse impacts on their domestic industries from trade liberalization processes. The Gazette Notification making the Anti Dumping Law operable was issued on the 09th of October 2020 and the law is in force from 10 Oct 2020. The order by the Minister under section 01 was published in the Gazzetta Extraordinary No. 2197/4 – dated 12th October 2020. Both the laws on paper appear to be comprehensive. Yet the levels of effectiveness can be evaluated only when the Ac stands the test of time. The reason/s for the delay in making the law operational is unclear. Section 84(1) of the Anti-Dumping Act authorizes the Minister to make regulations in respect of all matters required by the Act;the hold may be attributable to the formulation of the regulations. It may also be due to the setting up of infrastructure to facilitate the holding of inquiries, arming the officials with the necessary expertise for the successful implementation of the Act, or the contemplation of changes in policy and the introduction of further amendments to the already enacted laws. The effectiveness and/or whether the existing laws are sufficient to protect the domestic producers in the event of a surge of imports is debatable.

AIMS: We investigated how the COVID‐19 pandemic influenced surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), focusing on patients with hepatitis C virus infection who were receiving surveillance for HCC after sustained virologic response (SVR) in Japan. METHODS: Patients who achieved SVR between 1995 and 2017 and continued receiving surveillance were compared by month in terms of the rate at which they kept their scheduled visits for HCC surveillance from July 2019 to May 2020. RESULTS: The percentage of kept scheduled visits was above 97% before February 2020. By contrast, it declined sharply after March 2020 when COVID‐19 became pandemic; the percentages were 75.5% in March, 63.0% in April, and 49.1% in May 2020 (July 2019–February 2020 vs. March–May 2020, p<0.0001). Similar declines were observed in patients with cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis and in those with a history of HCC. Whereas most patients who cancelled a scheduled visit before February 2020 did not reschedule it, the majority of patients with cancellations after March 2020 did want to reschedule. CONCLUSIONS: The percentages of scheduled visits that were kept declined rapidly after COVID‐19 became pandemic in Japan, where the spread of COVID‐19 is relatively mild and the legal restriction of people’s behavior and movement is absent.

A global turbulence such as the COVID-19 pandemic has had a strong impact on individual companies and entire economic sectors, raising the question of whether a paradigm shift is necessary, in order to enable a new cycle of development that is much environmentally, socially and economically sustainable. This environmental and socio-economic context of profound uncertainty forces organizations to consider more carefully the risk factors affecting their business continuity, as well as how these factors relate to sustainability issues. However, there is a gap in knowledge about how risk management systems relate to sustainability management systems, and how both of them exert influence on business performance, especially from a theoretical point of view. The aim of this study is to address this gap, by developing a new interpretative framework for the analysis of risk management strategies in organizations. This approach has been identified in economic hermeneutics as an innovative methodological tool to improve the knowledge of risk and design the most appropriate management strategies. The paper provides two main results: the first one is the construction of a theoretical model that relates risk management to sustainability management; the second one is an operational framework of multidimensional risk assessment useful for analysis at different levels (business, competitive scenario and system). Finally, the model also makes it possible to carry out a sustainability assessment through risk evaluation in the perspective of the sustainable development goals.",2021-08-03,"Settembre-Blundo, Davide; González-Sánchez, Rocío; Medina-Salgado, Sonia; García-Muiña, Fernando E.",Glob J Flex Syst Manag,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/058c756a99daf144a09777f1c3f655bbbdff9f09.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8329640.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40171-021-00277-7,236913272.0

Better knowledge of risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for the prevention of disease among this population.Methods: We conducted a seroprevalence survey among HCWs in a French university hospital after the first wave (May-June 2020), based on a validated lateral flow immuno-assay test (LFIAT) for SARS-CoV-2. Demographic characteristics as well as data on the working characteristics of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 wards and 23 care activities were systematically recorded. The effectiveness of protective equipment was also estimated, based on self-declaration of mask use. SARS-CoV-2 IgG status was modelled by multiple imputations approach, accounting for the performance of the test and data on serum validation ELISA immunoassay.Findings: Among the 3,234 enrolled HCWs, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 3.8%. Contact with relatives or HCWs who developed COVID-19 were risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection, but not contact with COVID-19 patients. In multivariate analyses, suboptimal use of protective equipment during naso-pharyngeal sampling, patient mobilisation, clinical and eye examination was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, patients washing and dressing and aerosol-generating procedures were risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection with or without self-declared appropriate use of protective equipment.Interpretation: Main routes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 IgG among HCWs were i) contact with relatives or HCWs with COVID-19, ii) close or prolonged contact with patients, iii) aerosol-generating procedures.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (#35RC20_9716)Funding: This study was founded by the “NOMINOË” fund and the Rennes University HospitalDeclaration of Interests: None to declare.

Human exposure hinges significantly on LASV ecology, which is in turn shaped by various parameters such as weather seasonality and even virus and rodent-host genetics. Furthermore, human behaviour, despite playing a key role in the zoonotic nature of the disease, critically affects either the spread or control of human-to-human transmission. Previous estimations on LF burden date from the 80s and it is unclear how the population expansion and the improvement on diagnostics and surveillance methods have affected such predictions. Although recent data have contributed to the awareness of epidemics, the real impact of LF in West African communities will only be possible with the intensification of interdisciplinary efforts in research and public health approaches.

Occasionally, overlapped FDs are deployed to enhance the flow diversion effect. In this study, we investigated the hemodynamics of overlapping FDs via computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. We reproduced the arterial geometry of a patient who had experienced the deployment of two overlapping FDs. We utilized two stent patterns, namely the patterns for one FD and two overlapping FDs. We calculated the velocity, mass flow rate, wall shear stress, and pressure loss coefficient as well as their change rates for each pattern relative to the no-FD pattern results. The CFD simulation results indicated that the characteristics of the blood flow inside the aneurysm were minimally affected by the deployment of a single FD; in contrast, the overlapping FD pattern results revealed significant changes in the flow. Further, the velocity at an inspection plane within the aneurysm sac decreased by up to 92.2% and 31.0% in the cases of the overlapping and single FD patterns, respectively, relative to the no-FD pattern.

Academics have to improve their work in this vein in order to keep up with these developments. The same situation also applies to the studies conducted in the field ofpublic finance. While early studies in the field ofpublic finance focused around different topics, the current focus has changed completely. In particular, important events affecting the world, such as financial crises, trade wars, global outbreaks, income injustice, have shifted this focus.

Laboratory evaluation revealed leukopenia and an elevated C-reactive protein; imaging was consistent with acute appendicitis and an acute pulmonary viral infection. Though he lacked diffuse peritonitis on physical examination or a leukocytosis, he was found to have perforated appendicitis in the operating room. Our second patient was another 12-year-old male whose suspected appendicitis was confirmed via ultrasound and surgery. He tested positive for COVID-19 one month prior and he continued to test positive for infection on admission without any associated respiratory symptoms.

RESULTS: Process equity founded on social solidarity was central to the approach taken to vaccination in Norway but within the context of a very low level of COVID-19 Infection. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of Norway with very low levels of infection, the risks associated with vaccine side effects were of a similar order to the risk of infection which led to an early decision to exclude the AstraZeneca vaccine and limit access to the Janssen vaccine. Public trust in the way the state managed the changes in the vaccination programme resulted in very limited public resistance to the vaccine programme, high levels of vaccine uptake and an acceptance of delays associated with the exclusion of two approved vaccines.

j5ol0f2l,,Medline,Naegele's rule and the length of pregnancy - A review.,10.1111/ajo.13253,,33079400,unk,"BACKGROUND The proposition that a pregnancy is 40 weeks or 280 days in duration is attributed to the German obstetrician Franz Naegele (1778-1851). His rule adds nine months and seven days to the first day of the last menstrual period. The expected date of confinement from this formula is approximately right in the majority of cases. However, the idea that this rule can apply to every pregnant female - young or old, nulliparous or multigravida, Caucasian, Asian, African, or Indigenous - stretches credulity. In addition, many women regard the 40-week date as a deadline, which if crossed, may then place the baby under stress. Forty weeks is such a simple, round, convenient figure that it has proved difficult to challenge, despite criticism. Nonetheless, what might have been an appropriate formula in Germany in the 19th century deserves to be revisited in the 21st. AIMS To review the length of pregnancy, in the light of current technology, in particular ultrasound scanning, and assisted reproductive techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS A Medline search was performed for variables on the length of pregnancy, the expected date of confinement, and prolonged pregnancy. RESULTS A number of factors were found to significantly influence the length of a pregnancy, including ethnicity, height, variations in the menstrual cycle, the timing of ovulation, parity and maternal weight.

Paratyphi (S. Paratyphi) infection for public health management, through a literature review and case study. In 2016, a 36-year-old male presented with a five-day history of right sided painful neck swelling, coryza and a two-day history of fevers after arriving in Australia from India nine weeks earlier. S. Paratyphi A was isolated from a fine needle aspirate sample. A descriptive epidemiological review was performed of confirmed cases of S. Paratyphi notified in New South Wales between 2008 and 2017. S. Paratyphi was isolated in blood and/or faecal samples in 247 cases (98.4%). Only four specimens (1.6%) were from a focal site. A literature review of extraintestinal infections of S. Paratyphi A or B was performed. Of the 41 such cases reported, 16 (39%) had a clear history of a prior gastroenteritis and/or febrile illness, or information suggested this was highly likely. No preceding gastroenteritis or febrile illness occurred in 15 (37%) of the cases. Information was reviewed and presented with a public health lens, valuable for 'evidence-informed' public health risk assessment of contacts and exposures related to these types of S. Paratyphi infection. S. Paratyphi infection usually presents as an enteric fever illness. Our case illustrates the variable nature of infectious diseases and the importance of laboratory testing in obtaining a diagnosis. S. Paratyphi can have unusual presentations, which may require adjustment in the public health management of the case. Public health staff should keep an open mind when investigating possible sources and assessing risk. In Western Sydney, this disease is largely associated with residents travelling to high-incidence countries to visit family and friends, and receiving family visits from these countries. The increasing number of cases of S. Paratyphi (prior to COVID-19) in Western Sydney and the importance of awareness of the risk of enteric fever to travellers to endemic regions is highlighted.",2021,"Borsovszky, Moniek M; Norton, Sophie; Bag, Shopna K; Kok, Jen",Communicable diseases intelligence,,#covidwho-1579238,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34932934/; https://doi.org/10.33321/cdi.2021.45.66,245385112.0

We evaluate the temporal COVID-19 infection behavior among HCW-D, HCW-A, and non-HCW. MethodsFrom February 2020 to April 2021, trained nurses recorded age, gender, occupation, and symptoms in a COVID-19 testing outpatient health center. We allocated data into weekly time fractals and calculated the proportion of COVID-19 positive among HCW vs. non-HCW and incorporated an ARFIMA model (traditionally used in weather forecast) to predict future cases of COVID-19. ResultsAmong 8,998 COVID-19 RT-PCR tests, 3,462 (42%) patients were HCW-D, and 933 (11%) were HCW-A. Overall, 1,914 (21.3%) returned positive, representing 27%, 25% and 19% of HCW-D, HCW-A and non-HCW, respectively. HCW-D or HCW-A were significantly more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than non-HCW (OR=1.5, p<0.0001). The percentage of positive to negative test results remained steady over time. In the positive cases, the percentage of HCW to non-HCW declined significantly over time (Mann-Kendal trend test: tau=-0.58, p<0.0001). Our ARFIMA model showed a long-memory infection pattern in the occurrence of new COVID-19 cases lasting for months. Average error was 1.9 cases per week comparing predicted to actual values three months later (May-July 2021). ConclusionHCW have a sustained 50% higher risk of COVID-19 positivity in the pandemic.

Notably, the recent development of the HCV cell culture infection system now allows not only for the study of the entire viral life cycle, but also for the screening of inhibitors against all aspects of HCV infection. However, in order to screen libraries of potential antiviral compounds, it is necessary to develop a highly reproducible, accurate assay for HCV infection adaptable for high-throughput screening (HTS) automation. Using an internally quenched 5-FAM/QXL 520 fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) substrate containing the HCV NS3 peptide cleavage sequence, we report the development of a simple, mix-and-measure, homogenous, cell-based HCV infection assay amendable for HTS. This assay makes use of synchronized, nondividing human hepatoma-derived Huh7 cells, which support more-reproducible long-term HCV infection and can be readily scaled down to a 96-well-plate format. We demonstrate that this stable cell culture method eliminates common problems associated with standard cell-based HTS, such as cell culture variability, poor reproducibility, and low signal intensity. Importantly, this HCV FRET assay not only can identify inhibitors that act throughout the viral life cycle as effectively as more-standard HCV assays, such as real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis, but also exhibits a high degree of accuracy with limited signal variation (i.e., Z' > or = 0.6), providing the basis for a robust HTS campaign for screening compound libraries and identifying novel HCV antivirals.",2009,"Yu, Xuemei; Sainz, Bruno; Uprichard, Susan L",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00495-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19620334/,40171972.0
0xhv30ak,,WHO,Design of an engineered ACE2 as a novel therapeutics against COVID-19,,,,unk,"The interaction between the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) plays a pivotal role in virus entry into the host cells. Since recombinant ACE2 protein has been suggested as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic agent, this study was conducted to design an ACE2 protein with more desirable properties. In this regard, the amino acids with central roles in enzymatic activity of the ACE2 were substituted. Moreover, saturation mutagenesis at the interaction interface between the ACE2 and RBD was performed to increase their interaction affinity. The best mutations to increase the structural and thermal stability of the ACE2 were also selected based on B factors and mutation effects. The obtained resulted revealed that the Arg273Gln and Thr445Gly mutation have drastically reduced the binding affinity of the angiotensin-II into the active site of ACE2. The Thr27Arg mutation was determined to be the most potent mutation to increase the binding affinity. The Asp427Arg mutation was done to decrease the flexibility of the region with high B factor. The Pro451Met mutation along with the Gly448Trp mutation was predicted to increase the thermodynamic stability and thermostability of the ACE2. The designed therapeutic ACE2 would have no enzymatic activity while it could bear stronger interaction with Spike glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, decreased in vivo enzymatic degradation would be anticipated due to increased thermostability.

Our results showed that domestic dogs are potential shedder of three important pathogens: Canine distemper virus, Toxoplasma sp. and Neospora caninum. In particular, shepherd dogs seem to represent a threat for wildlife as they are exposed to multiple pathogens because of free-roaming, scavenging lifestyles and close proximity to livestock.

Such tools are also being applied to the design of vaccines against those viral targets that have evaded vaccine-mediated protection thus far. As basic immunological science intersects with the practicalities of assuring vaccine safety, tolerability, efficacy, and consistency in the clinic, the practical utility of more sophisticated immunological measures for vaccine development may be determined by whether they can be reduced to simply executed, highly standardized, reproducible assays with outcomes that have clear interpretations for vaccine development and use.

This meant no teaching for trainees through the teaching programmes, less connectivity between team members, low morale within the team. Objectives After a gap of 5 weeks, main objecting of starting once a week remote teaching on 30/04/2020, was to reinstate teaching and training opportunities in a safe and enjoyable manner and also boost team morale by 'staying connected with each other'. Methods PDSA included: 1. Gaining agreement from stakeholders in the Department. 2. Selecting a secure portal to run the teaching sessions remotely. We chose a portal that Trust was already using or higher management meetings. 3. Testing the portal one to one and then sharing the information with rest of the team. 4. Creating a teaching and training 'chat group' on the same secure portal for ease of communication. 5. Delivering first lecture by Organiser to 'break the ice' since technology was new to many. 6. Modifying the existing teaching rota to roster most trainees and including MDT sessions such safeguarding peer-review meetings, etc 7. Organiser helping with a trial run for a few minutes before the actual teaching session to avoid last minute issues or delay. 8. Constant development based on feedback from each teaching session until it became a 'norm' within the department by 6 weeks. Results Improved morale within the team. Some of the verbal and written feedback included 'it gave a sense of togetherness', 'positivity', 'enthusiasm', 'something to look forward to every week'. 'more interesting than face to face', 'less daunting', 'thoroughly enjoying'. Variation in attendance pre-covid (9-22) minimised to fairly constant attendance (15-22). Number of trainees attending without obligation when off work varied from 1-4 during each session. Those working in low risk areas or shielding completely, participates and attended more enthusiastically. After six weeks, from 16/06/2020, frequency of teaching programme increased to two times a week. Additional unexpected benefits were: . A trainee on maternity leave joined in remotely with a month old baby in her hand and she continued to do so afterwards until return to work. • A Greatix project was launched successfully for the department, without any undue delays waiting for face to face sessions. • Sharing of teaching material or feedback was almost instant after the teachings through the chat group whereas with face to face this wasn't a regular practice. Conclusions Remote teaching has a lot of potential to be part of our regular educational programmes, even when the current Pandemic is over. It can be an established way of 'keeping in touch' days for trainees away on maternity leaves or away from clinical area for any other reasons.

tc3sjyat,,WHO,A Comparative Study of Various Strategies in Dealing With Covid-19 for SMEs (preprint),10.2139/ssrn.3944866,,,unk,"In 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic upended society and industry, in organisations the negative affect of the crisis disturbed various processes. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the Netherlands struggled with constructing and implementing a proper approach for dealing with the crisis and adherence to the measures posed by the government. The ability for the organisations to rely on their past strategies regarding risk-management was not capable of continuing for such a long duration. Particularly since governmental regulations were highly dynamic as they changed quickly and were replaced. For many organisations Covid-19 created a high-risk work environment in which the resilient abilities of the organisations were addressed for survival. This research analyses handling of the Covid-19 crisis by using the concept of resilience in risk-management.The first section of the paper analyses the response of the Dutch government, the drawn up measurements are portrayed against the number of hospitalized patients. Next, we provide an overview of the concept of resilience and potential applications in solidarity, communication and scarcity are analysed on a national level. The second section focuses on practice, in which we look into organisations in different industries and their approaches for dealing with the Covid-crisis. The managerial decisions of three Dutch SMEs that operate both national and international have been analysed by conducting interviews. Resilience is proven to help in dealing with highly changing dynamic scenarios like the Covid-19 crisis;it is therefore coupled to the findings from the practical research. We concluded a number of guidelines from the interview results and literature review that aim to increase the resilient abilities of organisations. The guidelines are directed at the threshold for working from home, flexibility of offices and production lines, software for working from home, information use, supply chain flexibility, implementation of regulations and company culture.",2021,"Hilhorst, Twan Rajabalinejad Mohammad",,,#ppcovidwho-291556,,,,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3944866,239033029.0

Relaxed intervention measures and summer travel have been implicated as drivers of the second wave2. Here, we build a phylogeographic model to evaluate how newly introduced lineages, as opposed to the rekindling of persistent lineages, contributed to the COVID-19 resurgence in Europe. We inform this model using genomic, mobility and epidemiological data from 10 European countries and estimate that in many countries over half of the lineages circulating in late summer resulted from new introductions since June 15th. The success in onward transmission of newly introduced lineages was negatively associated with local COVID-19 incidence during this period. The pervasive spread of variants in summer 2020 highlights the threat of viral dissemination when restrictions are lifted, and this needs to be carefully considered by strategies to control the current spread of variants that are more transmissible and/or evade immunity.

This is important in resource-limited countries. This study determined the knowledge and perception regarding COVID-19; adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures; as well as predictors of self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 among Nigerian adults. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among Nigerian adults &#8805;18 years using an online survey. A convenience sampling method was utilized to recruit a total of 1022 study participants. The participants were recruited using the authors' social media networks. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics at a 5% level of statistical significance. Results: Generally, a high proportion of respondents had correct knowledge about COVID-19. However, only approximately half (49.8% and 49.9%) had correct knowledge that obesity was a risk factor for COVID-19 and that antibiotics cannot be used to treat COVID-19. Most (84.1%) did not have a self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19. Most (81.0%) have been avoiding crowded places and 61.3% washed their hands frequently.

Woebot is a mental health digital solution informed by cognitive behavioral therapy and built upon an artificial intelligence–driven platform to deliver tailored content to users. In a previous 2-week randomized controlled trial, Woebot alleviated depressive symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to adapt Woebot for the treatment of substance use disorders (W-SUDs) and examine its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy. METHODS: American adults (aged 18-65 years) who screened positive for substance misuse without major health contraindications were recruited from online sources and flyers and enrolled between March 27 and May 6, 2020. In a single-group pre/postdesign, all participants received W-SUDs for 8 weeks. W-SUDs provided mood, craving, and pain tracking and modules (psychoeducational lessons and psychotherapeutic tools) using elements of dialectical behavior therapy and motivational interviewing. Paired samples t tests and McNemar nonparametric tests were used to examine within-subject changes from pre- to posttreatment on measures of substance use, confidence, cravings, mood, and pain. RESULTS: The sample (N=101) had a mean age of 36.8 years (SD 10.0), and 75.2% (76/101) of the participants were female, 78.2% (79/101) were non-Hispanic White, and 72.3% (73/101) were employed. Participants’ W-SUDs use averaged 15.7 (SD 14.2) days, 12.1 (SD 8.3) modules, and 600.7 (SD 556.5) sent messages. About 94% (562/598) of all completed psychoeducational lessons were rated positively. From treatment start to end, in-app craving ratings were reduced by half (87/101, 86.1% reporting cravings in the app; odds ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.32-0.73). Posttreatment assessment completion was 50.5% (51/101), with better retention among those who initially screened higher on substance misuse. From pre- to posttreatment, confidence to resist urges to use substances significantly increased (mean score change +16.9, SD 21.4; P<.001), whereas past month substance use occasions (mean change −9.3, SD 14.1; P<.001) and scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise (mean change −1.3, SD 2.6; P<.001), 10-item Drug Abuse Screening Test (mean change −1.2, SD 2.0; P<.001), Patient Health Questionnaire-8 item (mean change 2.1, SD 5.2; P=.005), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (mean change −2.3, SD 4.7; P=.001), and cravings scale (68.6% vs 47.1% moderate to extreme; P=.01) significantly decreased. Most participants would recommend W-SUDs to a friend (39/51, 76%) and reported receiving the service they desired (41/51, 80%). Fewer felt W-SUDs met most or all of their needs (22/51, 43%). CONCLUSIONS: W-SUDs was feasible to deliver, engaging, and acceptable and was associated with significant improvements in substance use, confidence, cravings, depression, and anxiety. Study attrition was high. Future research will evaluate W-SUDs in a randomized controlled trial with a more diverse sample and with the use of greater study retention strategies.

It is a non-trivial task to build a good DNN model. Nowadays, various MLaaS providers have launched their cloud services, which trains DNN models for users. Once they are released, driven by potential monetary profit, the models may be duplicated, resold, or redistributed by adversaries, including greedy service providers themselves. To mitigate this threat, in this paper, we propose an innovative framework to protect the intellectual property of deep learning models, that is, watermarking the model by adding a new label to crafted key samples during training. The intuition comes from the fact that, compared with existing DNN watermarking methods, adding a new label will not twist the original decision boundary but can help the model learn the features of key samples better. We implement a prototype of our framework and evaluate the performance under three different benchmark datasets, and investigate the relationship between model accuracy, perturbation strength, and key samples’ length. Extensive experimental results show that, compared with the existing schemes, the proposed method performs better under small perturbation strength or short key samples’ length in terms of classification accuracy and ownership verification efficiency.",2020-04-17,"Zhong, Qi; Zhang, Leo Yu; Zhang, Jun; Gao, Longxiang; Xiang, Yong",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/2a83dc9aa879fbacdd2926a30a36bcdc1b8e89a3.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7206275.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206275/,

There is no doubt that the discovery of apoptosis and autophagy as two highly synchronized and regulated mechanisms in cellular homeostasis are among the most important discoveries in these decades. Along with the advancement in molecular biology, identifying the genetic players in apoptosis and autophagy has shed light on our understanding of their function in physiological and pathological conditions. In this review, we first describe the history of key discoveries in apoptosis with a molecular insight and continue with apoptosis pathways and their regulation. We touch upon the role of apoptosis in human health and its malfunction in several diseases. We discuss the path to the morphological and molecular discovery of autophagy. Moreover, we dive deep into the precise regulation of autophagy and recent findings from basic research to clinical applications of autophagy modulation in human health and illnesses and the available therapies for many diseases caused by impaired autophagy.

Consequently, an updated microscopic view of traffic shares is needed to understand how the Internet is evolving to capture both such shorter- and longer-term events. Toward this end, we observe traffic composition at a research network in Japan and a Tier-1 ISP in the USA. We analyze the traffic traces passively captured at two inter-domain links: MAWI (Japan) and CAIDA (New York-Sao Paulo), which cover 100GB of data for MAWI traces and 4TB of data for CAIDA traces in total. We begin by studying the impact of COVID-19 on the MAWI link: We find a substantial increase in the traffic volume of OpenVPN and rsync, as well as increases in traffic volume from cloud storage and video conferencing services, which shows that clients shift to remote work during the pandemic. For traffic traces between March 2018 to December 2018, we find that the use of IPv6 is increasing quickly on the CAIDA monitor: The IPv6 traffic volume increases from 1.1% in March 2018 to 6.1% in December 2018, while the IPv6 traffic share remains stable in the MAWI dataset at around 9% of the traffic volume. Among other protocols at the application layer, 60%-70% of IPv4 traffic on the CAIDA link is HTTP(S) traffic, out of which two-thirds are encrypted; for the MAWI link, more than 90% of the traffic is Web, of which nearly 75% is encrypted. Compared to previous studies, this depicts a larger increase in encrypted Web traffic of up to a 3-to-1 ratio of HTTPS to HTTP. As such, our observations in this study further reconfirm that traffic shares change with time and can vary greatly depending on the vantage point studied despite the use of the same generalized methodology and analyses, which can also be applied to other traffic monitoring datasets.",2022-01-01,"Schumann, Luca; Doan, Trinh Viet; Shreedhar, Tanya; Mok, Ricky; Bajpai, Vaibhav",,,,2201.00142,document_parses/pdf_json/2d132bec3ac7062f660d97132882f8a90538c5d9.json,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.00142v2.pdf,245650518.0

Previously, India had global record of highest single day spike of Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) cases, with 97,894 cases on 17th September 2020. Aim: To find out the demographic and clinical characteristics of critically ill patients of SARS-CoV-2 and comparing the outcomes of patients admitted in COVID dedicated Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with and without co-morbidities and also in different age groups and sex.Material and Methods: This retrospective study from July 2020 to December 2020 was a single centre observational experience of management of COVID-19 patients at COVID dedicated ICU in Firozabad, India. The following data were recorded: Age, sex, comorbidities and mode of oxygen delivery (invasive mechanical ventilation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, high flow nasal canula). Chi-square test was used to compare the outcomes of patients admitted in COVID dedicated ICU with and without co-morbidities and also in different age groups and sex.Results: In this study, the data of 120 severely ill COVID-19 patients were reviewed. The mean age of patients were (58±15.29) years and male to female ratio was 3:1. At least one comorbid condition was reported in 53.3% of patients-most common being Hypertension (36.6%) followed by Diabetes mellitus 2 (20%), COPD (15%). Then Cardiovascular Diseases, Renal, Liver diseases and ailments followed. All patients admitted to COVID ICU had moderate to severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Older age (61 years and above, mortality 17%), male sex (16.7% deaths among 90 critically ill male COVID patients) and presence of comorbid conditions appear to have higher mortality in this study. However apart from comorbid conditions (p=0.001) none was statistically significant. The overall mortality in this study of 120 critically ill COVID patients was 14.16%.Conclusion: From this study, it can be suggested that survival of critically ill COVID patients can further be improved by better management of their comorbid conditions and avoiding complications of invasive ventilation. However, further multicentric studies with large sample size are needed to confirm these findings.",2021,"Verma, R.; Nishad, R.

bga3f4ac,,WHO,Criticizing green stimulus for COVID recovery,,,,unk,"Abstract Recent calls by world leaders recommend that policy responses to the COVID crisis incorporate ?green stimulus? or ?green recovery? as a vital element. In a 2014 article in this journal, we argued that green stimulus would be an inefficient way to either boost demand and restore full employment in the context of the global financial crisis or pursue long-run environmental goals. In this paper, we argue that the attempt to marry green and COVID recovery programs may prove an even less fitting response to the near-term crisis, while still threatening to put environmental policy on paths that prove inefficient in the long run. We argue that green stimulus/recovery, while yielding more long-term climate benefits, would likely generate a slower and smaller recovery in jobs and activity than a traditional macroeconomic stimulus. This creates a trade-off for policymakers. The global financial crisis provides our primary real-world experience of green stimulus/recovery policies. A small but growing number of ex post empirical studies suggest that these measures' near-term growth impact was less than expected or obtained at a relatively high cost. There is also a danger that orienting green programs toward near-term shocks like the global financial crisis and COVID could compromise public understanding of, political support for, and the quality of environmental and climate policies in the long run.

Some adverse reactions have resulted in the discontinuation of the specific vaccines use in some countries. Countries in poor regions have faced difficulties supplying enough vaccine doses, and the emergence of new variants of concern has resulted in reduced effectiveness of available vaccines against COVID‐19. The mix‐and‐match strategy, using heterologous vaccines in the first and second doses, might successfully solve the mentioned struggles.

We model the market demand and investment cost as the geometric Brownian motions with jumps driven by the Poisson processes. A new computing method independent on specific distribution functions is proposed for the real option models with jump processes of random frequency and amplitude. Based on this method, we find that both firms delay investment with a larger capacity as uncertainties of demand and investment cost increase. We also demonstrate that two firms both invest later and the optimal capacity relationship between them is ambiguous in the presence of two sources of uncertainty. Numerical simulation reveals that upward (downward) jump in demand and downward (upward) jump in investment cost cause the firms to invest earlier (later) with a larger (smaller) capacity. Finally, in a duopoly with symmetric firms, the first investor invests earlier than in an asymmetric duopoly due to the threat of preemption.",2021-08-21,"Wu, Xiaoqin; Hu, Zhijun",Math Finan Econ,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/032cd5961d1e355bd72662ffefc1bec42887522e.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8380023.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8380023/,

Many of these transduction pathways such as JAK/STAT signal via proteins commonly activated with other antiviral signalling cascades, such as those induced by IFNs. GM-CSF also helps defend against respiratory infections by regulating alveolar macrophage differentiation and enhancing innate immunity in the lungs.

The aim of our systematic review was to investigate symptoms and diagnostic-therapeutic management of IBD patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and MedRxiv up to July 29, 2020, to identify all studies reporting clinical information on adult and pediatric IBD patients with confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies met our inclusion criteria, including 243,760 IBD patients. COVID-19 was diagnosed in 1028 patients (509 with Crohn's disease [49.5%], 428 with ulcerative colitis [41.6%], 49 with indeterminate colitis [4.8%], and 42 with missing data [4.1%]), accounting for a cumulative prevalence of 0.4%. Viral infection occurred more frequently in males than in females (56.5% vs 39.7%), and the mean age ranged from 14 to 85 years. The most common symptoms were fever (48.3%), cough (46.5%), and diarrhea (20.5%), and a COVID-19 diagnosis was achieved mainly through polymerase chain reaction analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs (94.4%) and chest computed tomography scans (38.9%). Hydroxychloroquine (23.9%), lopinavir/ritonavir (8.2%), steroids (3.2%), and antibiotics (3.1%) were the most used drugs. Overall, approximately a third of patients were hospitalized (30.6%), and 11.4% of them required admission to the intensive care unit. In total, 29 COVID-19-related deaths were reported (3.8%), and increasing age and the presence of comorbidities were recognized as risk factors for COVID-19 and negative outcomes.

From pathogenic and epidemiological perspectives, spike proteins are of prime interest to researchers. This study focused on the unique variants of S proteins from six continents: Asia, Africa, Europe, Oceania, South America, and North America. In comparison to the other five continents, Africa had the highest percentage of unique S proteins (29.1%). The phylogenetic relationship implies that unique S proteins from North America are significantly different from those of the other five continents. They are most likely to spread to the other geographic locations through international travel or naturally by emerging mutations. It is suggested that restriction of international travel should be considered, and massive vaccination as an utmost measure to combat the spread of COVID-19 pandemic.

The Targeted Interdisciplinary Model for Evaluation and Treatment of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms (TIME) might be a useful personalized approach to BPSD in people with dementia. The main objective of this feasibility trial was to explore the trial design and methods along with the patients’ and the home care staff’s acceptance of the TIME intervention before developing a definitive trial. Additionally, we wanted to explore whether TIME could be appropriate for staff in home care services in their approach towards people with dementia with anxiety and depression. METHODS: This was a 18-month feasibility trial using a parallel cluster randomized controlled design. Nine municipalities from the eastern part of Norway (clusters) — 40 people with dementia and 37 of their next of kin— were randomized to the TIME intervention or to treatment as usual. In addition, qualitative data as field notes were collected and summarized. RESULTS: The staff in home care services experienced TIME as an appropriate method; in particular, the systematic approach to the patient’s BPSD was experienced as useful. However, the completion of the assessment phase was considered exhaustive and time-consuming, and some of the staff found it challenging to find time for the case conferences. CONCLUSIONS: We consider that TIME, with some adjustments, could be useful for staff in home care services in cases where they face challenges in providing care and support to people with dementia. This feasibility trial indicates that we can move forward with a future definitive randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the effect of TIME in people with dementia receiving home care services.

Traditional epidemiologic models choose to simplify reality by ignoring both the spatial distribution of populations and possible intrapopulation heterogeneities, whereas more recent solutions based on Individual-Based Modeling (IBM) can achieve high precision but are costly to compute and analyze. We introduce here an original alternative to these two approaches, which relies on a novel hybrid modeling framework and incarnates a multiscale view of epidemics. The model relies on a technical fusion of two modeling paradigms: System Dynamics (SD) and Individual-Based Modeling. It features an aggregated representation of local outbreaks rendered in SD, and at the same time a spatially-explicit simulation of the spread between populations simulated in IBM. We first present the design of this deterministic model, show that it can reproduce the dynamics of real resurgent epidemics, and infer from the sensitivity of several spatial factors absent in compartmental models the importance of having large-scale epidemiological processes represented inside of an explicitly disaggregated metapopulation. After discussing the implications of results obtained from simulation runs and the applicability of this model, we conclude that SD–IB hybrid modeling can be an interesting choice to represent epidemics in a spatially-explicit way without necessarily taking into account individual heterogeneities, and therefore it can be considered as a valuable alternative to simple compartmental models suffering from detrimental effects of the well-mixed assumption.",2011-07-31,"Vincenot, Christian Ernest; Moriya, Kazuyuki",Ecological Informatics,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7d08ab9263350322887d9ae6bd87304a710d0ff3.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7185514.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1574954111000331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362804/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2011.04.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574954111000331,7885906.0

They colonize a large number of patients without invading them. Systemic glucocorticoids are currently used to treat severe Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). In such patients, opportunistic fungal infections are a problem. Although COVID-19-related pulmonary aspergillosis is becoming more common, mucormycosis is still uncommon. Mucormycosis normally appears 10 to 14 days after being admitted to the hospital. Mucormycosis is a rare but dangerous infection that can make extreme COVID-19 worse. Mucormycosis is more likely to occur in people who have diabetes mellitus and other risk factors. Mucormycosis is most likely exacerbated by concurrent glucocorticoid treatment. To improve outcomes, a high index of suspicion and aggressive management is required. Excessive usage of steroids, monoclonal antibodies, and broad-spectrum antibiotics might cause the formation or worsen of a fungal infection. A high index of suspicion and aggressive management are needed. In patients with COVID-19 infection, physicians should be vigilant of the likelihood of subsequent invasive fungal infections. To enhance results in pulmonary mucormycosis, early diagnosis and treatment are critical. Confirmation of the clinical form necessitates a combination of symptoms that are consistent with tissue invasion histologically. Combining various clinical data and the isolation of the fungus from clinical samples in culture is needed for the probable diagnosis of mucormycosis. The organism that causes mucormycosis is identified using macroscopic and microscopic morphological criteria, carbohydrate assimilation, and the maximum temperature at which they can expand.

Mechanical ventilation remains the cornerstone of supportive therapy for ARDS. Lung-protective mechanical ventilation minimizes the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and improves survival. Several parameters are determinants of VILI and require careful setting, such as tidal volume (VT), plateau pressure (Pplat), driving pressure (DP), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and respiratory rate. Furthermore, measurement of energy and mechanical power may enable quantification of the relative contribution of its different components (VT, Pplat, ΔP, PEEP, respiratory rate, and airflow) and better individualize mechanical ventilation settings. The use of neuromuscular blocking agents is of interest, mainly in cases of severe ARDS, to improve oxygenation and reduce asynchrony; however, no significant changes in survival have been observed.

METHODS: The present project designed to evaluate the inhibition of AChE by following standard procedures. RESULTS: Statistical analysis of the results showed that Silene arenosa exerted 73% inhibition against the krait venom acetylcholinesterase at fixed substrate acetylcholine (ACh) concentration (0.5 mM). Kinetic analysis using the Lineweaver Burk plot revealed that Silene arenosa caused a competitive type of inhibition i.e. Km values increased from 26.6 to 93.3 mM (26.6% to 93.3%) and Vmax remained constant in a concentration-dependent manner. Silene arenosa competes with the substrate to bind at the active site of the enzyme. The Kmapp of venom AChE for Silene arenosa increased from 60% to 81.6% and the Vmaxapp remains constant. Ki (inhibition constant was estimated to be 48 µg for snake venom; while the Km (Michaelis-Menten constant of AChE- substrate into AChE and product) was estimated to be 0.5 mM.

TRIAL DESIGN: A two-arm (1:1 ratio) cluster randomised controlled trial implementing Germ Defence via GP practices compared with usual care. PARTICIPANTS: Setting: All Primary care GP practices in England. Participants: All patients aged 16 years and over who were granted access by participating GP practices. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention: We will ask staff at GP practices randomised to the intervention arm to share the weblink to Germ Defence with all adult patients registered at their practice during the 4-month trial implementation period and care will otherwise follow current standard management. Germ Defence is an interactive website (http://GermDefence.org/) employing behaviour change techniques and practical advice on how to reduce the spread of infection in the home. The coronavirus version of Germ Defence helps people understand what measures to take and when to take them to avoid infection. This includes hand washing, avoiding sharing rooms and surfaces, dealing with deliveries and ventilating rooms. Using behaviour change techniques, it helps users think through and adopt better home hygiene habits and find ways to solve any barriers, providing personalised goal setting and tailored advice that fits users’ personal circumstances and problem solving to overcome barriers. Comparator: Patients at GP practices randomised to the usual care arm will receive current standard management for the 4-month trial period after which we will ask staff to share the link to Germ Defence with all adult patients registered at their practice. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is the effects of implementing Germ Defence on prevalence of all respiratory tract infection diagnoses during the 4-month trial implementation period. The secondary outcomes are: 1) incidence of COVID-19 diagnoses 2) incidence of COVID-19 symptom presentation 3) incidence of gastrointestinal infections 4) number of primary care consultations 5) antibiotic usage 6) hospital admissions 7) uptake of GP practices disseminating Germ Defence to their patients 8) usage of the Germ Defence website by individuals who were granted access by their GP practice RANDOMISATION: GP practices will be randomised on a 1:1 basis by the independent Bristol Randomised Trials Collaboration (BRTC). Clinical Commission Groups (CCGs) in England will be divided into blocks according to region, and equal numbers in each block will be randomly allocated to intervention or usual care. The randomisation schedule will be generated in Stata statistical software by a statistician not otherwise involved in the enrolment of general practices into the study. BLINDING (MASKING): The principal investigators, the statistician and study collaborators will remain blinded from the identity of randomised practices until the end of the study. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): To detect planned effect size (based on PRIMIT trial, Little et al, 2015): 11.1 million respondents from 6822 active GP practices. Assuming 25% of these GP practices will engage, we will contact all GP practices in England spread across 135 Clinical Commissioning Groups. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version 2.0, dated 13 January 2021. Implementation is ongoing. The implementation period started on 10 November 2020 and will end on 10 March 2021.

Its impact on performance materializes mainly through consumer perception of risk and the resilience of the supply chain networks. The extent to which countries are prepared to identify and respond to these risks adequately is a critical factor. We therefore construct an index of epidemiological susceptibility risk (ESR), which we use to predict business performance around the world. The index captures the role of infrastructure, demographics, economic activity and institutional governance. It proves a significant predictor of corporate sales growth. It also fares well in explaining business performance during the Covid-19 pandemic. The results remain robust to various sensitivity and endogeneity tests and after controlling for different non-economic and institutional factors. The ESR captures diverse conditions, which may amplify or contain the contagion of epidemiological risk, and therefore it could potentially be a useful tool for predicting and managing epidemic outbreaks and their consequences on business sustainability. © 2021 British Academy of Management and Wiley Periodicals LLC",2021,"Mertzanis, C.",British Journal of Management,,#covidwho-1276484,,,,,236274979.0

Many clinics reopened but required universal SARS-CoV-2 screening. However, the rate of positive results and the necessity for such testing is unknown. We report here on early results from asingle-center academic NewYork fertility practice utilizing universal SARS-CoV-2 screening. This mixed prospective retrospective cohort included 164 patients who underwent at least one SARS-CoV-2 screening test for fertility treatment between May and July2020. Patients completed 1 to 3 nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 tests per cycle and remained symptom-free to continue fertility treatments. SARS-CoV-2 test results, past results, history of Covid-19 infection, and patient/cycle characteristics were recorded and tabulated through October2020. Outcomes included positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests, rate of prior Covid-19 infections, and clinical courses of patients testing positive. Patients underwent 263 cycles entailing 460 total SARS-CoV-2 screening tests. Fifteen patients reported astrong prior clinical history of Covid-19. Six patients experienced apositive SARS-CoV-2 test (2.3% of all cycles). Among 77 cycles (n = 58 patients) entailing one SARS-CoV-2 test, 2 cases (2.6%) were noted. Among 173 cycles (n = 121 patients) entailing two SARS-CoV-2 tests, 4 cycles (2.3%) were noted. Zero (0%) of 13 cycles (n = 13 patients) entailing 3 SARS-CoV-2 tests were positive. All patients were cleared to resume treatment within one month. Overall, anew asymptomatic infection was identified in 2 cycles (0.8%), while 4 of the 6 positive SARS-CoV-2 tests were among patients with aprior history of Covid-19. 3 of 4 also had adocumented prior positive RNA test. Our data suggest that universal SARS-CoV-2 screening among fertility patients is feasible, with an approximately 2% positive rate per cycle among the patients of this study. Most positive patients had aprior remote infection, but their infectiousness while being screened remains unclear.Abbreviations: REI: reproductive endocrinology and infertility; IUI: intrauterine insemination; IVF: in vitro fertilization; sono: sonography; cryo: cryopreservation; FET: frozen embryo transfer.",2021-03-16,"Gingold, Julian A; Galperin, Sharon; Fowler, Sabrina; Kappy, Michelle; Pollack, Staci; Singh, Manvinder; Lieman, Harry; Jindal, Sangita",Systems biology in reproductive medicine,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/19396368.2021.1884317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33726574/,232261276.0

However, the challenge of vaccine hesitancy may lower the uptake rate and affect overall vaccine efficacy. Being a low-risk group in terms of serious consequences of infection, university students may possess low motivation to get vaccinated. Therefore, an expanded Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) incorporating perceived knowledge, adaptive response, and maladaptive response was proposed to investigate the COVID-19 vaccination intention among Taiwanese university students. University students (n = 924; 575 males; mean age = 25.29 years) completed an online survey during January to February 2021. The proposed expanded PMT model was examined using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results showed that perceived knowledge was significantly associated with coping appraisal (standardized coefficient (β) = 0.820; p < 0.001), and coping appraisal was significantly associated with adaptive response (β = 0.852; p < 0.001), maladaptive response (β = 0.300; p < 0.001) and intention (β = 0.533; p = 0.009). Moreover, maladaptive response (β = −0.173; p = 0.001) but not adaptive response (β = 0.148; p = 0.482) was significantly and negatively associated with intention.

However, a heart transplant (HT) after such support remains challenging. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the immediate and long-term results following an HT in the cohort of patients who had a TAH-t implant. METHODS A total of 73 patients were implanted with the TAH-t between 1988 and 2019 in our centre. Of these 73 consecutive patients, 50 (68%) received an HT and are included in this retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. RESULTS In the selected cohort, in-hospital mortality after an HT was 10% (n = 5). The median intensive care unit stay was 33 days (range 5-278). The median hospital stay was 41 days (range 28-650). A partial or total pericardiectomy was performed during the HT procedure in 21 patients (42%) due to a severe pericardial reaction. Long-term survival rates after an HT at 5, 10 and 12 years were 79.1 ± 5.9% (n = 32), 76.5 ± 6.3% (n = 22) and 72.4 ± 7.1% (n = 12), respectively, which was similar to the long-term survival for a primary HT without TAH-t during the same period (n = 686). An HT performed within 3-6 months post-TAH-t implantation appeared to provide the best survival (P = 0.007). Eight (16%) patients required chronic dialysis during the subsequent follow-up period, with 3 patients requiring a kidney transplant. CONCLUSIONS The long-term outcomes with the SynCardia TAH-t as a bridge to transplant in patients with severe biventricular failure are very encouraging.

A rapid inactivation protocol capable of inactivating virions, as well as endogenous nucleases, was optimized to increase sensitivity and sample stability. This protocol, combined with the RT-LAMP assay, has a sensitivity of at least 50 viral RNA copies per microliter in a sample. To further increase the sensitivity, a purification protocol compatible with this inactivation method was developed. The inactivation and purification protocol, combined with the RT-LAMP assay, brings the sensitivity to at least 1 viral RNA copy per microliter in a sample.

DESIGN To develop the CR model, we conducted a literature review in medicine, psychology, early childhood development, neurobiology, and disaster preparedness and response and applied system dynamics modeling to analyze the complex interactions between public systems, policies, and community. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The CR model focuses on community and population health outcomes associated with the policies and practices of the housing, public education, law enforcement, and criminal justice sectors as CR measures. The model demonstrates how behaviors of these systems interact and produce outcome measures such as employment, homelessness, educational attainment, incarceration, and mental and physical health. RESULTS The policies and practices within housing, public schools, law enforcement, and criminal justice can suppress resilience for families and communities because they are shaped by structural racism and influence the character and nature of resources that promote optimal community health and well-being. CONCLUSIONS Community resilience is relational and place-based and varies depending on the demographic makeup of residents, historical patterns of place-based racism and discrimination, jurisdictional policy, and investment priorities-all influenced by structural racism.

The potential of biocidal agents against SARS-CoV-2,,,,unk,"Biocidal agents such as formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde are able to inactivate several coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. In this article, an insight into one mechanism for the inactivation of these viruses by those two agents is presented, based on analysis of previous observations during electron microscopic examination of several members of the orthocoronavirinae subfamily, including the new virus SARS-CoV-2. This inactivation is proposed to occur through Schiff base reaction-induced conformational changes in the spike glycoprotein leading to its disruption or breakage, which can prevent binding of the virus to cellular receptors. Also, a new prophylactic and therapeutic measure against SARS-CoV-2 using acetoacetate is proposed, suggesting that it could similarly break the viral spike through Schiff base reaction with lysines of the spike protein. This measure needs to be confirmed experimentally before consideration. In addition, a new line of research is proposed to help find a broad-spectrum antivirus against several members of this subfamily.",2021,"Shaheen, Alaa",Bioessays,,#covidwho-1184571,,,,,233258176.0

For this purpose a special branching process with two types of individuals is considered. This model is intended to use only the observed daily statistics to estimate the main parameter of the contamination and to give a prediction of the mean value of the non-observed population of the contaminated individuals. This is a serious advantage in comparison with other more complicated models where the observed official statistics are not sufficient. In this way the specific development of the Covid-19 epidemics is considered for different countries.,2020-04-02,"Yanev, Nikolay M.; Stoimenova, Vessela K.; Atanasov, Dimitar V.",,,,2004.00941,document_parses/pdf_json/db4bd9a68431bd3e71294fc82bf3eb387305368d.json,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00941v1.pdf,214774688.0

Ceftobiprole (BPR), a new-generation cephalosporin, is a therapeutic option against E. faecalis. Here, we present evidence that pbp4 gene sequence alterations may influence the expression level of the gene and ceftobiprole binding to PBP4 in E. faecalis clinical isolates showing remarkable MDR-phenotypes, and how this could interfere with BPR in vitro antibacterial and bactericidal activity. Seven E. faecalis strains from bloodstream infections were analyzed for their antibiotic and β-lactam resistance. BPR bactericidal activity was assessed by time-kill analysis; pbp4 genes were sequenced and pbp4 relative expression levels of transcription were performed by RT-qPCR. Five penicillin-resistant ampicillin-susceptible (PRAS) isolates were detected, 4 of which were also BPR non-susceptible (BPR-NS). In the time-kill experiments, BPR exposure resulted in a potent bactericidal activity (3-5 log(10) reduction) at the different concentrations tested. pbp4 gene sequence analysis revealed some mutations that may account for the changes in PBP4 affinity and MIC increase in the 4 BPR-NS strains (MICs 4-16 mg/L): the deletion of an adenine (delA) in the promoter region in all PRAS/BPR-NS strains; 12 different amino acid substitutions, 7 of which were next to the PBP catalytic-sites. The most significant were: T418A, located 6 amino acids (aa) upstream of the catalytic-serine included in the (424)STFK(427) motif I; L475Q, 7 aa upstream of the (482)SDN(484) motif II; V606A and the novel Y605H, 13/14 aa upstream of the (619)KTGT(622) motif III. Taken together, our data showed that elevated BPR MICs were attributable to increased transcription of pbp4 - associated with a single upstream adenine deletion and PBP4 alterations in the catalytic-site motifs – which might interfere with the formation of the BPR/PBP4 complex. pbp4 molecular alterations may account for the changes in PBP4 affinity and MIC increase, without affecting BPR cidal activity. Indeed, our in vitro dynamic analysis by time-kill assays showed that BPR exerted a bactericidal activity against E. faecalis clinical isolates, despite their MDR phenotypes.",2022-01-20,"Lazzaro, Lorenzo M.; Cassisi, Marta; Stefani, Stefania; Campanile, Floriana",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e54a304f3048f3fb55bf562bffd3fb07741b6936.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35127564/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.816657,246037113.0

It is associated with disability, as well as increased morbidity and mortality. Despite its significant repercussions in our society, its exact pathophysiology remains unclear and therefore, available antidepressant treatment options are limited and, in some cases, ineffective. In the past years, research has focused on the development of a multifactorial theory of depression. Simultaneously, evidence supporting the role of the endocannabinoid system in the neurobiology of neuropsychiatric diseases has emerged. Studies have shown that the endocannabinoid system strongly impacts neurotransmission, and the neuroendocrine and neuroimmune systems, which are known to be dysfunctional in depressive patients. Accordingly, common antidepressants were shown to have a direct impact on the expression of cannabinoid receptors throughout the brain. Therefore, the relationship between the endocannabinoid system and major depressive disorder is worth consideration. Nevertheless, most studies focus on smaller pieces of what is undoubtedly a larger mosaic of interdependent processes. Therefore, the present review summarizes the existing literature regarding the role of the endocannabinoid system in depression aiming to integrate this information into a holistic picture for a better understanding of the relationship between the two.",2021-12-06,"Gallego-Landin, Ines; García-Baos, Alba; Castro-Zavala, Adriana; Valverde, Olga",Front Pharmacol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/9cf73421c25b6909a473b56605354976b636f1f3.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8685322.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.762738; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34938182/,244897101.0

Patients receiving valproic acid may require a zidovudine dosage reduction to maintain unchanged serum zidovudine concentrations (Level C). Coadministration of valproic acid and efavirenz may not require efavirenz dosage adjustment (Level C). Patients receiving ritonavir/atazanavir may require a lamotrigine dosage increase of ∼50% to maintain unchanged lamotrigine serum concentrations (Level C). Coadministration of raltegravir/atazanavir and lamotrigine may not require lamotrigine dosage adjustment (Level C). Coadministration of raltegravir and midazolam may not require midazolam dosage adjustment (Level C). Patients may be counseled that it is unclear whether dosage adjustment is necessary when other AEDs and ARVs are combined (Level U). It may be important to avoid enzyme-inducing AEDs in people on ARV regimens that include protease inhibitors or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, as pharmacokinetic interactions may result in virologic failure, which has clinical implications for disease progression and development of ARV resistance. If such regimens are required for seizure control, patients may be monitored through pharmacokinetic assessments to ensure efficacy of the ARV regimen (Level C).",2012,"Birbeck, G L; French, J A; Perucca, E; Simpson, D M; Fraimow, H; George, J M; Okulicz, J F; Clifford, D B; Hachad, H; Levy, R H",Neurology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0b013e31823efcf8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22218281/,29890043.0

Outcomes and Antibiotic Use in Patients with COVID-19 Admitted to an Intensive Care Unit,10.1093/ofid/ofab466.487,PMC8644144,,cc-by,"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown the proportion of critically ill patients with COVID-19 receiving empiric antibiotics (ABX) greatly exceeds those with culture-proven bacterial co-infections. However, the benefits of continuing ABX in culture-negative (CxN) cases is unknown; this practice may increase the risks associated with ABX overuse. The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes and antibiotic use (AU) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19 based on culture results. METHODS: This was a multicenter, retrospective cohort study evaluating adults in an ICU for the first episode of ABX initiated following a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis between September to December 2020. Blood and/or respiratory cultures must have been obtained within 24 hours (h) of ABX initiation. Patients were categorized into three groups: 1) CxN, ABX discontinued ≤ 72 h, 2) CxN, ABX continued > 72 h, or 3) Culture-positive (CxP). Data on AU was obtained from electronic medication administration records. The primary outcome was clinical success, defined as being discharged alive or > 2-point decrease in the World Health Organization Clinical Progression Scale score from day of ABX initiation to day 30. RESULTS: A total of 65 patients were included with 35.4% being CxP. ABX were discontinued ≤ 72 h in 23.8% of CxN patients. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism in 52.2% of CxP patients (66.7% respiratory; 16.7% blood; 16.7% both). Anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and anti-pseudomonal antibiotics were the most prescribed for the initial regimen (Table 1). ABX de-escalation occurred in 58.5% of patients. Initial ABX duration was significantly longer in the CxP group (P < 0.01). No significant difference in clinical success was observed (Table 2). Although not significantly different, the highest rate of adverse events occurred in the CxN and ABX continued > 72 h group (40.6%). Table 1. Antibiotic Use in ICU Patients with COVID-19 [Image: see text] Table 2. Clinical Outcomes and Adverse Events in ICU Patients with COVID-19 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: In ICU patients with COVID-19, empiric broad-spectrum ABX are often overutilized with an inertia to de-escalate despite negative culture results, potentially increasing the risk of adverse events.

SUMMARY INTRODUCTION The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has catalized several changes in many fields of our lives, and also at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University of Debrecen, Hungary. OBJECTIVES We wanted to analyse the compound effect of our new local protocols regarding elective labour inductions at term, the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting infection control measures, the merging of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Ward of the Kenézy County Hospital of Debrecen and the University Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and also the change of the legal environment. METHODS Local protocols were introduced: 1. Labour induction. 2. Cervical ripening in labour induction. 3. Choosing the route of delivery after cesarean. 4. Management of pregnancy around term in the case of planned trial of labour after cesarean. We compared the obstetrical data (number of deliveries, cesarean section rate, perinatal outcome and the rate and success rate of labour inductions) before and after the implementation of the protocols. The results were also compared to the Hungarian national database. RESULTS The annual cesarean rate at our department dropped to 33.5% in 2020. In the first 9-month period, after the introduction of the new reforms, the cesarean rate decreased to 30.7%, whereas the Hungarian national rate was 40.3% in 2020. At our department, 20% of all the deliveries were induced and 74% of them led to vaginal deliveries in 2020, while in 2019 only 11% of deliveries were labour inductions, and 47% of these cases were vaginal deliveries. The monthly number of deliveries was rising constantly between January 2020 (250 deliveries) and January 2021 (450 deliveries), and the monthly cesarean rate decreased from 41% to 25%. Comparing the data of 2019 and 2020, the annual perinatal mortality rate dropped from 6.3‰ in 2019 to 4.2‰ in 2020. Neonatal morbidity, as measured by admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit, also decreased (14.8% in 2019 and 13.5% in 2020). CONCLUSIONS As a compound result of the described factors, but mainly due to the new protocols, both the rate and the success rate of labour inductions increased significantly, while the cesarean rate decreased with improving perinatal mortality and morbidity.

Unlike other cities, we found the air quality has improved slightly over the Atlanta area during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown period (March 14–April 30, 2020), compared to the analogous period of 2019 (March 14-April 30, 2019). Ground NO2 concentrations have decreased slightly 10.8% and 8.2% over the near-road (NR) and urban ambient (UA) stations, respectively. Tropospheric NO2 columns have reduced 13%-49% over the Atlanta area from space-borne observations of TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). Ground ozone and PM2.5 have decreased 15.7% an ~5%, respectively. This slight air quality improvement is primarily caused by the reduced human activities, as COVID-19 lockdowns have reduced ~50% human activities, measured by traffic volume. Higher wind speed and precipitations also make the meteorological conditions favorable to this slight air quality improvement. We have not found a significant improvement in Atlanta amid the lockdown when human activities have reduced ~50%. Further studies are needed to understand the impacts of reduced human activities on atmospheric chemistry. We also found TROPOMI and ground measurements have disagreements on NO2 reductions, as collocated TROPOMI observations revealed ~23% and ~21% reductions of tropospheric NO2 columns over NR and UA stations, respectively. Several factors may explain this disagreement: First, tropospheric NO2 columns and ground NO2 concentrations are not necessarily the same, although they are highly correlated in the afternoon;Second, meteorological conditions may have different impacts on TROPMI and ground measurements.

Here, we examined the association between cannabis use history and an especially topical health-behavior, willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: COVID-19 vaccine willingness was surveyed in a subset of participants from the Tulsa 1000 Study, which is a longitudinal study of psychiatric treatment-seeking and healthy control participants. We identified 45 participants who completed a COVID-19 vaccine questionnaire and reported more than 10 lifetime cannabis uses. Those participants were compared to a group of 45 individuals with very light (<10) cannabis use histories who were propensity score-matched on age, sex, income, and race. Two-group t-tests and Bayes factor analysis on vaccine willingness were conducted between groups. Exploratory correlation analyses were conducted on vaccine willingness and lifetime cannabis use levels within the cannabis group only. RESULTS: Vaccine willingness did not differ between the two groups (t(88)=0.33, p=.74; BF(01)=4.3). However, a negative correlation was identified within the cannabis group, such that higher lifetime cannabis use histories correlated with less willingness to receive a vaccine (rho(43)= −.33, p=.03). CONCLUSIONS: Although vaccine willingness did not differ between the two matched groups, preliminary evidence suggests that heavy lifetime cannabis use might indicate a reluctance to engage in health-promoting behaviors like receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.",2021-04-28,"Spechler, Philip A.; Stewart, Jennifer L.; Kuplicki, Rayus; Paulus, Martin P.",medRxiv,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/39404a1917567e07a60fbede2679044bc37f561c.json; document_parses/pdf_json/a5365405a9c6457c4de5410820f7d3d04249e342.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8095213.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33948603/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.26.21256109; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.26.21256109v1?rss=1,233421288.0

This paper introduces the development of a service robot that is designed for food service in fast-food restaurants with the innovative improvement of mapping, localization, and navigation. Moreover, this research took the initiative of integrating 3D point cloud map and 2D occupancy grid map (OGM) in order to build a PC-OGM. In another word, using the sensory fusion method allows the service robot to adapt to a more complicated environment as well as enhance its positioning. In terms of its navigation function, the adaptive motion controller is refined so the service robot could navigate through narrow aisles smoothly. Finally, friendly contact-free food service robots were evaluated at fast-food restaurants in order to gain feedback from diners and waiters. Their feedback was broken down into 3 categories, availability, reliability, and satisfaction, for further analysis. As COVID-19 assails the world, we also look into future possibilities of food service robot deployment among restaurants to keep food and surface free from the virus. Author",2022,"Chen, C.

Our goal was to report our experience with the replacement and implementation of linear accelerators with radiosurgery capabilities at SOLCA hospital in Quito, Ecuador and give some recommendations for future Technological replacements (TRs). Methods Two surveys were performed in SOLCA’s radiosurgery department, one before the TR was finalized and one after, consisting of an open and multiple-choice questionnaire. Questions focused on the performance of the new equipment, perceptions regarding the training, and the influence of the pandemic on the whole process. Additionally, we share our experience regarding the difficulties and benefits of TR at SOLCA. Results The most reported limitation was lack of training (48%). By the time of the second survey, 95.2% of the staff had already treated patients or planned a radio-surgical procedure;42.9% considered training to have been adequate, and 76.2% felt that the pandemic hindered the training process. Currently, 33 radiosurgeries have been done (26 for the central nervous system and 7 stereotactic radiation body therapies). Conclusion The TR in SOLCA had similarities with other experiences in LMIC, but the pandemic brought additional limitations, mainly complicating the staff training. Nevertheless, those limitations can be resolved with a structured training program and international collaboration. Overall, the benefits obtained from a TR result in exponentially better medical care and accessibility to novel treatments.",2022,"Ochoa, Pamela Puente-Vallejo Raul Loza Felipe Cueva Fiorella Leon-Rojas Jose E.",World Neurosurgery,,#covidwho-1796024,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2022.04.035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35430401/,248198292.0

However, mRNA's short cytoplasmic half-life limits its utility to therapeutic applications amenable to repeated dosing or short-term overexpression. Here, we describe a biomaterial that enables a durable in vivo response to a single mRNA dose via an ""overexpress and sequester"" mechanism, whereby mRNA-transfected cells locally overexpress a growth factor that is then sequestered within the biomaterial to sustain the biologic response over time. In a murine diabetic wound model, this strategy demonstrated improved wound healing compared to delivery of a single mRNA dose alone or recombinant protein. In addition, codelivery of anti-inflammatory proteins using this biomaterial eliminated the need for mRNA chemical modification for in vivo therapeutic efficacy.

Many surgical procedures are continuing to be performed during this state of pandemic as is thoracic surgery. We present six cases of tube thoracostomy in COVID-19 patients and the modifications to the routine surgical technique. METHODS: We serially attached two closed underwater drainage systems (CUDS) together and added a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to the port of the second CUDS, because the intrapleural air, which passes through the CUDS into the air in intensive care unit (ICU), may contain high concentrations of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Second, we attached the chest drain to the first CUDS in order to prevent the spread of virus during the placement of drain into the pleural cavity. Third, just before opening the parietal pleura, ventilation was put on standby mode and the endotracheal tube was clamped to prevent viral dissemination to the environment. Fourth, we covered the incision with a gauze sponge soaked with sterile saline solution during pleural entry, to prevent viral dissemination into the environment. RESULTS: There were a total of six patients enrolled in our study. All these patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. The surgical indication for the chest tube thoracostomy was tension pneumothorax in all six patents. All patients had lung expansion defects and subcutaneous emphysema after intervention. Unfortunately, all of them succumbed to COVID-19, despite best available treatment. There was no COVID-19 infection reported in the healthcare professionals during this study. CONCLUSIONS: Thoracic surgical procedures may cause dissemination of high amounts of 2019-nCoV in the environment and thus are perhaps the most dangerous surgeries to perform.

The primary endpoint was time to initial treatment failure (TF), defined as HbA1c &#8805;7.0% at two consecutive scheduled visits after randomisation. The time to secondary TF was assessed when both groups were receiving and failing on the combination. A total of 186 (9.3%) patients had YOD and 1815 (90.7%) had LOD with a mean age difference of 20.4 years. Compared with metformin monotherapy, early combination reduced the risk of time to initial TF for both YOD (48%, p < 0.0006) and LOD (46%, p < 0.0001). With early combination, risk for time to secondary TF was reduced by 48% (p < 0.0035) in YOD and 24% (p < 0.0009) in LOD. Both treatment approaches were well-tolerated with no unexpected safety concerns.

The most frequently reported pathology is conjunctivitis, which may be the first or only clinical manifestation of the disease. Involvement of SARS-CoV-2 in development of alterations in other ocular structures was suggested, including the cornea, the retina, and blood vessels. Possible mechanisms include direct activity of the viral agent, as well as systemic inflammatory response with accompanying thromboembolic complications. Genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in ocular secretions of infected individuals, including asymptomatic patients. Moreover, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor protein used by the virus to enter the cell, has been found on the surface of various structures of the eye, which indicates a risk of transmission through ocular tissues. Therefore, it is crucial to use eye protection by medical professionals having contact with potentially infected patients. This paper is a review of the literature regarding ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and a summary of the current state of knowledge about possibility of transmission from an ophthalmology point of view.

Distant metastases are seen in 50% of cases regardless of treatment, which contributes to high mortality rates. Polo-like kinase-1 (PLK-1) is a protein regulator of mitotic entry and cytokinesis. Increased PLK-1 expression has been shown in different tumours, which makes its inhibition a potential treatment target. To date, no study has been published to discuss the prognostic role of PLK-1 expression in patients with uveal melanoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS . We assessed by immunohistochemistry PLK-1 expression in uveal melanoma cells collected in 158 patients treated by primary enucleation. We determined the correlation between PLK-1 levels evaluated by the immunoreactivity scale (IRS) method and detailed clinical as well as histological parameters. Additionally, we determined the association between PLK-1 expression levels and long-term prognosis. RESULTS Elevated PLK-1 expression in tumour cells, defined as IRS >2, was observed in 70% (111/158) of cases, whereas low expression or no expression was seen in the remaining 30% (47/158) of patients. There was a significant correlation between low PLK-1 expression and a higher clinical tumour stage (pT, p = 0.04) as well as a higher AJCC prognostic stage group (p = 0.037). We observed an inverse correlation between PLK-1 expression and tumour cell pigment content (p = 0.0019). There was no correlation between PLK-1 expression and other histological parameters such as mitotic rate or histological subtype. The Kaplan-Meier's analysis demonstrated that low PLK-1 expression was associated with significantly reduced overall survival (p = 0.0058). A similar trend, albeit not significant, was observed for disease-free survival (p = 0.088). CONCLUSIONS . Downregulated PLK-1 expression is a negative prognostic factor in uveal melanoma. It warrants further, multicentre research on prognostic role of PLK-1 expression and possibility of PLK-1 inhibition in uveal melanoma.",2020-06-30,"Berus, Tomasz; Markiewicz, Anna; Zwierzchowska, Katarzyna; Biecek, Przemyslaw; Orlowska-Heitzman, Jolanta; Romanowska-Dixon, Bozena; Donizy, Piotr",Folia histochemica et cytobiologica,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.5603/fhc.a2020.0017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32602935/,220268974.0

Ventilators evaluated: Covidien PB 840, Maquet Servo-i, and Dräger Evita XL, PC breaths at preset inspiratory time (TI) 0.6-1.4s. VT error was defined as ventilator displayed VT minus the simulator displayed VT (mL/kg or % of true). RESULTS Relaxation of inspiratory effort caused flow reversal (exhalation) during TI, which led to VT error. For the PB 840, VT error was proportional to TI (maximum -2.0mL/kg, -19%). For the Servo-i, VT error was not related to TI (maximum error -0.2mL/kg or -1.2%). Volume error for Evita XL was not related to TI (maximum error was -0.7mL/kg or -6%). CONCLUSIONS Calculation of VT as the integral of flow over the preset inspiratory time rather than the period between zero crossings of flow may result in underestimation of both inhaled and exhaled volumes. The size of VT error can be large enough to potentially affect patient outcomes on some ventilators.",2016,"Chatburn, Robert L; Mireles-Cabodevila, Eduardo; Sasidhar, Madhu",Computers in biology and medicine,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2016.06.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27318572/,1955499.0

This paper reviews the present advancements and their benefits and limitations in the field of telesurgery. A handful of operations have been done so far. However, due to time-lag (latency), global networking problems, legal issues and skepticism, and on top of the cost of robotic systems and their affordability have led to the concept of telerobotics and surgery to lag. However, with more information and high speed, 5G networking, which has been in a trial to reduce latency to its minimum, is beneficial. Haptic feedback technology in telesurgery and robotics is another achievement that can be improved; further, this allows the robotic arms to mimic the natural hand movements of the surgeon in the control center so that the master controller can perform surgeries with more dexterity and acuity.

However, there is scarce evidence supporting the relationship between SB and urinary incontinence (UI) in community-dwelling older adults, and no information on any possible association in institutionalised older adults. Stage I of this project has the main objective of determining the prevalence of UI and its associated factors in nursing home (NH) residents, as well as analysing the association between UI (and its types) and SB. Stage II aims to investigate the incidence and predictive factors of functional and continence decline, falls, hospitalisations, mortality and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among NH residents. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Stage I is an observational, multicentre, cross-sectional study with mixed methodology that aims to explore the current status of several health-related outcomes in NH residents of Osona (Barcelona, Spain). The prevalence ratio will be used as an association measure and multivariate analysis will be undertaken using Poisson regression with robust variance. Stage II is a 2-year longitudinal study that aims to analyse functional and continence decline, incidence of falls, hospitalisations, mortality and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these outcomes. A survival analysis using the actuarial method for functional decline and continence, evaluated every 6 months, and the Kaplan-Meier method for falls, hospitalisations and deaths, and Cox regression for multivariate analysis will be undertaken.

This brought the need to adapt working practices and find ways to continue providing compassionate patient-centred care remotely. In UK radiotherapy departments, radiation therapist (review radiographer)-led clinics moved to telephone-based clinics to reduce the time spent by patients in a hospital environment. This required setting up a ""virtual"" clinic room with patients by removing distractions and setting boundaries for the conversation. We have had to adapt our communication skills quickly as picking up on nonverbal cues is not possible through the phone. It can be challenging to understand feelings through the tone of a patient's voice and empathise accordingly. The pandemic has forced patients to slow down and really focus on themselves which has led to picking up physical and mental health changes earlier.

Estudio multicéntrico regional en España,10.1016/j.endinu.2021.12.003,PMC8941531,35340791,no-cc,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study is to determine whether during the year 2020, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increase in the incidence of diabetes mellitus in children compared to the previous 2 years. It is also to find out if lockdowns and the difficulty providing face-to-face care in the health system have led to children showing more severe symptoms at the time of diagnosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective observational multicenter study of the province of Tarragona where data is collected from new diagnoses of type 1 diabetes mellitus in patients under the age of 15 during the year 2020 and compared with years 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: The number of new diagnoses of type 1 diabetes during 2020 was 37 cases compared to 2019 and 2018 which was 23 and 29 respectively. The median age at onset was 9 years, 54% males. There was an increase in new diagnoses in the range of 10 to14-year-olds, with a decrease in the range of 0 to 4 year-olds. In 2020, the incidence in the group of patients with families from the Maghreb area rose from 52.2 cases per 100,000 population/year (c/10(5) p-y) in 2019 to 135.8 in 2020. Compared to the previous year, 2020 showed a significant decrease of ketoacidosis at the onset. None of the patients was diagnosed with COVID-19 during admission. CONCLUSION: During the year 2020 concurring with the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in the number of new diagnoses of type 1 diabetes mellitus in pediatrics. Contrary to expectations, the presentation did not worsen by decreasing the proportions of ketoacidosis at onset. This data would suggest that, although attendance in the different health facilities dropped drastically during the year 2020 at the expense of virtual consultations, health systems and families were able to detect the symptoms of the disease early.",2022-02-14,"Hernández Herrero, María; Terradas Mercader, Pilar; Latorre Martinez, Ester; Feliu Rovira, Albert; Rodríguez Zaragoza, Neus; Parada Ricart, Ester",Endocrinol Diabetes Nutr,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/4274c0df81944305798ee959a3b49d7e1dc73e50.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8941531.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2530016422000362; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.endinu.2021.12.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35340791/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2530016422000362,247617421.0

OXT administration blocked the increase in voluntary ethanol consumption observed in defeated mice, although it did not affect motivation for ethanol. An increase in the striatal levels of CX3CL1 and CXCL12 was observed in defeated animals immediately after the last defeat and after the ethanol SA.

In the Czech Republic, the first three cases of infection with the novel coronavirus were confirmed on March 1, 2020. The joint effort of state authorities and researchers gave rise to a unique team, which combines methodical knowledge of real-world processes with the know-how needed for effective processing, analysis, and online visualization of data. OBJECTIVE: Due to an urgent need for a tool that presents important reports based on valid data sources, a team of government experts and researchers focused on the design and development of a web app intended to provide a regularly updated overview of COVID-19 epidemiology in the Czech Republic to the general population. METHODS: The cross-industry standard process for data mining model was chosen for the complex solution of analytical processing and visualization of data that provides validated information on the COVID-19 epidemic across the Czech Republic. Great emphasis was put on the understanding and a correct implementation of all six steps (business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation, and deployment) needed in the process, including the infrastructure of a nationwide information system; the methodological setting of communication channels between all involved stakeholders; and data collection, processing, analysis, validation, and visualization. RESULTS: The web-based overview of the current spread of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic has been developed as an online platform providing a set of outputs in the form of tables, graphs, and maps intended for the general public. On March 12, 2020, the first version of the web portal, containing fourteen overviews divided into five topical sections, was released. The web portal's primary objective is to publish a well-arranged visualization and clear explanation of basic information consisting of the overall numbers of performed tests, confirmed cases of COVID-19, COVID-19-related deaths, the daily and cumulative overviews of people with a positive COVID-19 case, performed tests, location and country of infection of people with a positive COVID-19 case, hospitalizations of patients with COVID-19, and distribution of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: The online interactive overview of the current spread of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic was launched on March 11, 2020, and has immediately become the primary communication channel employed by the health care sector to present the current situation regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. This complex reporting of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Czech Republic also shows an effective way to interconnect knowledge held by various specialists, such as regional and national methodology experts (who report positive cases of the disease on a daily basis), with knowledge held by developers of central registries, analysts, developers of web apps, and leaders in the health care sector.",2020,"Komenda, Martin; Bulhart, Vojtech; Karolyi, Matej; Jarkovský, Jirí; Muzík, Jan; Májek, Ondrej; Snajdrová, Lenka; Ruzicková, Petra; Rázová, Jarmila; Prymula, Roman; Macková, Barbora; Brezovský, Pavel; Marounek, Jan; Cerný, Vladimír; Dusek, Ladislav",J Med Internet Res,,#32412422,,,,,218650034.0
5wzbn3eh,,Medline,The viral spike protein is not involved in the polarized sorting of coronaviruses in epithelial cells.,,,9420251,unk,"Coronaviruses are assembled by budding into a pre-Golgi compartment from which they are transported along the secretory pathway to leave the cell. In cultured epithelial cells, they are released in a polarized fashion; depending on the virus and cell type, they are sorted preferentially either to the apical domain or to the basolateral plasma membrane domain. In this study, we investigated the role of the coronavirus spike protein, because of its prominent position in the virion the prime sorting candidate, in the directionality of virus release. Three independent approaches were taken. (i) The inhibition of N glycosylation by tunicamycin resulted in the synthesis of spikeless virions. The absence of spikes, however, did not influence the polarity in the release of virions. Thus, murine hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) was still secreted from the basolateral membranes of mTAL and LMR cells and from the apical sides of MDCK(MHVR) cells, whereas transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) was still released from the apical surfaces of LMR cells. (ii) Spikeless virions were also studied by using the MHV-A59 temperature-sensitive mutant Albany 18. When these virions were produced in infected LMR and MDCK(MHVR) cells at the nonpermissive temperature, they were again preferentially released from basolateral and apical membranes, respectively. (iii) We recently demonstrated that coronavirus-like particles resembling normal virions were assembled and released when the envelope proteins M and E were coexpressed in cells (H. Vennema, G.-J. Godeke, J. W. A. Rossen, W. F. Voorhout, M. C. Horzinek, D.-J. E. Opstelten, and P. J. M. Rottier, EMBO J. 15:2020-2028, 1996). The spikeless particles produced in mTAL cells by using recombinant Semliki Forest viruses to express these two genes of MHV-A59 were specifically released from basolateral membranes, i.e., with the same polarity as that of wild-type MHV-A59. Our results thus consistently demonstrate that the spike protein is not involved in the directional sorting of coronaviruses in epithelial cells. In addition, our observations with tunicamycin show that contrary to the results with some secretory proteins, the N-linked oligosaccharides present on the viral M proteins of coronaviruses such as TGEV also play no role in viral sorting. The implications of these conclusions are discussed.",1998,"Rossen, J W; de Beer, R; Godeke, G J; Raamsman, M J; Horzinek, M C; Vennema, H; Rottier, P J",Journal of virology,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9420251/,16814314.0

We aim to inform the deliberations of decision makers in high-income settings regarding their cervical cancer screening policy response. We caution against performance measures that rely solely on restoring testing volumes to pre-pandemic levels because they will be less effective at mitigating excess cancer diagnoses than will targeted measures. These measures might exacerbate pre-existing inequalities in accessing cervical screening by disregarding the risk profile of the individuals attending. Modelling of cervical screening outcomes before and during the pandemic supports risk-based strategies as the most effective way for screening services to recover.

The review further attempts to highlight future research perspectives. Increasing evidence suggests that environmental exposures, climate changes and lifestyle are important risk factors for AR. Consequently, detailed investigation of the exposome and the connection between environmental exposures and health in the future should provide better risk profiles instead of single predictors, and also help mitigate adverse health outcomes in allergic diseases. Although patients with dual AR, a newly defined AR phenotype, display perennial and seasonal allergens-related nasal symptoms, they are only allergic to seasonal allergens, indicating the importance of measuring inflammation at the local sites.

Par ailleurs si dans le domaine chimique et radiologique il existe de nombreux appareils de détection pouvant être mis en œuvre sur le terrain, les capacités sont beaucoup plus réduites dans le domaine biologique. Cette nécessité de disposer d’une capacité d’analyse environnementale d’agents pathogènes a été identifiée précocement par le Bataillon de marins-pompiers de Marseille (BMPM) et l’émergence de la crise sanitaire liée à la COVID-19 a permis le développement de procédés innovants ouvrant à terme de nouvelles perspectives. S’appuyant sur l’expertise en prélèvements des personnels armant le VDIP (véhicule détection identification prélèvements) le BMPM s’est associé à un laboratoire de biotechnologies en capacité d’analyser par RT-PCR les échantillons fournis à la recherche de présence d’ARN de SARS-CoV-2. L’objectif initial était d’avoir une cartographie de la présence virale dans les emprises du BMPM et de s’assurer de l’efficience des procédures de bionettoyage. Une fois les techniques fiabilisées et les seuils de détection affinés cette capacité opérationnelle a été proposée à la ville de Marseille, aux Armées et acteurs institutionnels. Fort de cette technicité et de cette expérience le BMPM a acquis des PCR pouvant être embarquées à bord du VDIP. Cette capacité ouvre des perspectives intéressantes dans le cadre du spectre des menaces biologiques. En effet, à condition de disposer des amorces spécifiques des agents de la menace biologique, il sera ainsi possible suite à une revendication ou une découverte suspecte de pouvoir répondre rapidement sur la présence ou pas des agents de la menace directement sur site. Unlike pathogens defined by an incubation period preceding their clinical expression, biological warfare agents affect the body within hours of exposure. This may delay the identification of a collective infectious phenomenon. Many detection devices can be used in chemical and radiological hazards, but few options exist in biological hazard. The need for skills to analyse pathogens in the environment was early identified by the BMPM (Marseille navy fire battalion); and the Covid-19 health crisis enabled innovative processes and opened up new perspectives. Thanks to the expertise of ‘VDIP’ (vehicle for detection, identification and sampling) technicians, the BMPM collaborated with a biotechnology lab to analyse by RT-PCR the provided samples for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The main goals were to map the virus’ presence in the BMPM grounds and to ensure the bio cleaning procedures efficiency. Once the techniques were considered as reliable, and once the detection limits were assessed, this operational capability was proposed to the city of Marseille, to the French Army and to institutional stake holders. With these skills and experience, the BMPM acquired on-board PCR devices in the VDIP. This skill opens up interesting perspectives in the biological hazard field. Indeed, with a specific biological threat PCR primer, it will thus be possible to quickly assess the presence of on-site biological warfare agents in case of any suspicious activity.",2021-03-30,"Beaume, Sébastien; Cazes, Nicolas; Peduzzi, Frank; Augier, Patrick",,,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1279847921000367?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1279847921000367,232422514.0

RESULTS Between November 2003 and November 2006, 59 bronchoalveolar episodes from 55 HIV-infected patients were analysed. Eleven of 59 episodes (18.6%) were positive for at least one respiratory virus. Coronavirus OC43 was identified in three cases (27.3%) followed by influenza A in two (18.2%). Parainfluenza virus (PIV) 2, PIV 3, PIV 4, bocavirus, human rhinovirus A and human metapneumovirus were each identified in one case (9%). In the majority of these cases (63.6%) no other concomitant microorganism was isolated.

Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) is a rare complication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection that may appear at any stage of the disease. In this case, AIDP represents a late presentation of HIV infection. METHODS Descriptive study. Patient data were collected from their medical records and by health assessment interviews. RESULTS We report a case of a 52-year-old male with acute lower limb weakness. Given the suggestive clinical presentation of AIDP and a positive HIV test, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was administered along with antiretroviral therapy. Progressive weakness to the upper limbs, autonomic dysfunction, and pain was observed. The second regimen of IVIG plus corticosteroids was administered. Muscle strength improved after three weeks.

Even before the pandemic began, our ageing and growing populations, living with more co-morbidities, presented significant challenges to health systems and economies globally. This book is therefore both timely and relevant to the single most important issue of today and tomorrow-our collective health. It provides unique analysis of the challenges facing the public's health today, furnished with examples, illustrations and innovative proposals for moving forward and transforming our health. Fresh insights into why our health matters to each of us both individually and collectively as society, are put forward-although we are living longer, more of these years are spent in poor health and this will continue to impact more people in years to come. In characteristic style, the chapters harness a vision for positive change by going much further than just diagnosing the problem;they dissect the drivers (making the point that our health is not inevitable, these are not 'determinants') of the wider health environment through novel approaches. This encompasses well described social drivers of health, to more novel commercial drivers of health, capturing both how they drive the world and the environment that we live in. They also draw on the positive commercial drivers of old as demonstrated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The book focuses on the healthcare system. Their vision of transforming healthcare systems from 'importers of illness to exporters of health' is supported by the compelling case of the potential reward in achieving this goal, and the imperative to do so, alongside pragmatic, yet innovative, approaches that embrace emerging technologies and data analytics.

Despite the construction industry being a major potential source of employment for refugees, there has been a surprising lack of research into their experiences of securing work in the industry. Addressing this gap and also the general lack of voice for refugees in construction research, the aim of this paper is to explore the barriers refugees face in securing employment in the construction industry.Design/methodology/approach>This paper reports a survey of refugees who have worked or attempted to seek work in the Australian construction industry.Findings>Results show that the main barriers to securing employment in construction are: lack of local work experience;employer discrimination;employer failure to recognise previous qualifications, skills and experience and employers not understanding the challenges they face. Government employment agencies and systems are also perceived to be of limited value and overly complex, in contrast to the activities of not-for-profit support agencies.Research limitations/implications>While the research is limited to Australia, the findings contribute an important and missing refugee dimension to the emerging body of research on construction social procurement. They also contribute unique sector-specific insights into the broader debate about refugee resettlement and employment. Further research is needed in other national contexts.Practical implications>Recommendations are made to address the barriers to employment identified including: initiatives to provide refugees with work experience in the industry;education to break-down negative stereotypes of refugees among employers;greater support for not-for-profits supporting refugees and reform of government and employment agency systems and procedures.Social implications>By enhancing understanding of the barriers to employment for refugees in construction and proposing solutions to reduce those barriers, this research contributes new insights into a growing global challenge of how we better integrate growing numbers of refugees into harmonious and prosperous societies.Originality/value>The findings are important in facilitating the smoother integration of refugees into society.

A review of the literature and the results of observation of patients who are currently receiving therapy with inosine pranobex (IP) according to the standard regimen (as the second stage after organ-preserving cervical surgery) indicate the absence of any abnormalities during the postoperative period. Moreover, publications on the interaction of IP and COVID-19 provide a chance for a favorable outcome regarding not only the treatment of CIN, but also minimizing the inflammatory syndrome in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusion. The use of IP as medication-assisted (postoperative) treatment of patients with CIN-HPV in the COVID-19 pandemic conditions is, firstly, as effective with respect to cervical pathology as it is outside the pandemic;secondly, in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, it can potentially reduce the severity of the course and consequences of respiratory viral infection.",2021,"Davydov, A.

In its native state, the last 56 amino acids of the ectodomain C terminus (C-term) occlude binding to its receptors, herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) and nectin-1. Although it is clear that movement of the C-term must occur to permit receptor binding, we believe that this conformational change is also a key event for triggering later steps leading to fusion. Specifically, gD mutants containing disulfide bonds that constrain the C-term are deficient in their ability to trigger fusion following receptor binding. In this report, we show that two newly made monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), MC2 and MC5, have virus-neutralizing activity but do not block binding of gD to either receptor. In contrast, all previously characterized neutralizing anti-gD MAbs block binding of gD to a receptor(s). Interestingly, instead of blocking receptor binding, MC2 significantly enhances the affinity of gD for both receptors. Several nonneutralizing MAbs (MC4, MC10, and MC14) also enhanced gD-receptor binding. While MC2 and MC5 recognized different epitopes on the core of gD, these nonneutralizing MAbs recognized the gD C-term. Both the neutralizing capacity and rate of neutralization of virus by MC2 are uniquely enhanced when MC2 is combined with MAb MC4, MC10, or MC14. We suggest that MC2 and MC5 prevent gD from performing a function that triggers later steps leading to fusion and that the epitope for MC2 is normally occluded by the C-term of the gD ectodomain.",2012,"Lazear, Eric; Whitbeck, J Charles; Ponce-de-Leon, Manuel; Cairns, Tina M; Willis, Sharon H; Zuo, Yi; Krummenacher, Claude; Cohen, Gary H; Eisenberg, Roselyn J",Journal of virology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.06480-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22130533/,206819062.0

The objective of this research is to determine the incidence of major bleed in postsurgical neonates and infants treated with ketorolac, and to describe characteristics of ketorolac therapy and its effect on renal function. METHODS This retrospective review assessed postsurgical patients younger than 6 months of age, without renal and/or coagulation dysfunction, who received ketorolac for postoperative pain during the study period. Major bleed was defined as a decrease in hemoglobin by ≥ 2 g/dL in a 24-hour period and/or intracranial, intraventricular, gastrointestinal, or pulmonary hemorrhage. Renal injury was identified per pediatric-modified RIFLE (risk, injury, failure, loss, end stage renal disease) criteria. RESULTS One hundred twenty-five patients were analyzed, having a mean dosing weight of 5.6 kg, gestational age of 37.2 weeks, and postnatal age of 3.8 months. Ketorolac therapy was most frequently 0.5 mg/kg intravenously every 6 hours with a mean of 6.7 doses administered. The primary endpoint of major bleed occurred in 2 (1.6%) 2-month-old patients of 39 weeks' gestation. Both bleeds were characterized by decrease in hemoglobin without evidence of clinically significant bleeding. One (0.8%) and 3 (2.4%) patients experienced a decrease in glomerular filtration rate and urine output, respectively. Sixty-two (49.6%) patients received a concomitant medication associated with decreased bleeding risk.

In addition to distinguish COVID-19 from Healthy, H1N1, and CAP cases, our M 3 Lung-Sys also be able to locate the areas of relevant lesions, without any pixel-level annotation. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on a chest CT imaging dataset with a total of 734 patients (251 healthy people, 245 COVID-19 patients, 105 H1N1 patients, and 133 CAP patients).

However, there is a lack of studies using nationally representative data from middle-aged and older adults in Germany. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the frequency and correlates of online consultations with doctors or therapists in Germany. METHODS: For this study, cross-sectional data were taken from the nationally representative German Ageing Survey (DEAS; n=3067 in the analytical sample; age range 46-98 years). As part of the DEAS, a short survey was conducted between June 8 and July 22, 2020, examining the everyday life and living conditions among these middle-aged and older individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The frequency of online consultations with doctors or therapists served as the dependent variable (daily, several times a week, once a week, 1-3 times a month, less often, and never). Multiple logistic regressions were performed. RESULTS: In sum, 10.02% (381/3806) of individuals with access to the internet had online consultations with doctors or therapists. Multiple logistic regressions showed that the likelihood of using online consultations with doctors or therapists (compared with those never using such services) was positively associated with higher education (compared with medium education; odds ratio [OR] 1.31, 95% CI 1.01-1.70), living with a partner in the same household (compared with single; OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.05-2.22), poorer self-rated health (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.16-1.74), increased loneliness (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.10-1.90), and increased satisfaction with life (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.03-1.64). CONCLUSIONS: Study findings suggest that a non-negligible proportion of about 1 out of 10 individuals aged 46 years and over had online consultations with doctors or therapists. However, compared with other countries, this proportion remains small. Knowledge about the correlates of (non)use may assist in identifying corresponding individuals.

CONCLUSION: Patients with psoriasis who received biological therapy continued their treatment at a high rate during the early period of the COVID‐19 pandemic. No COVID‐19 diagnosis was made among patients whether they continued or discontinued treatment.

Nowadays, populations make extensive use of alternative medicine for their health problems. Bidens pilosa (B. pilosa) and Cymbopogon citratus (C. citratus) are used individually in the traditional treatment of cardiovascular disorders. This study assessed the effects of the mixture of these two plants aqueous extract on HBP in rats. Male rats (42) were divided into 7 groups of 6 rats each. Normotensive rats received only distilled water and formed group 1. The other animals received ethanol + salt preceded by distilled water (10 mL/kg; group 2) and spironolactone (10 mg/kg; group 3); the aqueous extracts of the mixture (100 and 200 mg/kg; groups 4 and 5) isolated plants B. pilosa (200 mg/kg; group 6) and C. citratus (200 mg/kg; group 7). Animals were treated for 7 weeks during which water consumption and urine volume were assessed; then, hemodynamic parameters were recorded, and rats were sacrificed. Serum and some organs (liver, kidney, heart, and aorta) were used to evaluate biochemical parameters. Ingestion of ethanol + salt leads to a significant increase in urinary volume and water intake that were significantly prevented by the extracts from the mixture and isolated plants. Ethanol + salt solution significantly increased the blood pressure, heart rate, triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-chol), very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-chol), atherogenic indices, liver and kidney function parameters, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. However, the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-chol), albumin, reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were significantly reduced. The extracts of the mixture and isolated plants significantly prevented all these variations with a more pronounced action for the lowest dose of the mixture on the lipid profile, oxidative stress, and kidney function.

More specifically, exploring the first stages in the learning process through embedding declarative knowledge utilising both video content and learner profiles, with the purpose to make teaching practice more effectively and efficiently targeted. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative social experimental approach was employed. The sample consisted of 414 students from three post primary schools in Northern Ireland. Students were randomly allocated into both control and experimental video content groups. All participants were made aware of ethical procedures and the nature of the study. Findings Through the application of latent class analysis (LCA), three distinct types of students were classified. Class one (n = 250) students were termed independent learners, class two (n = 88) students were motivated and benefited from video-based learning and class three (n = 52) students demonstrated an inability to apply information because video did not assist in embedding declarative knowledge. Research limitations/implications Implications from this research inform content generation for video-based cooking skills. Practical implications Given the unprecedented move towards online teaching in 2020 due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) restrictions, there is increasing interest in targeting resources effectively to meet the requirements of all learning groups.

Affective response following sedentary time may influence motivation to remain sedentary. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is a real-time data capture methodology that can be used to identify factors influencing sedentary time, such as the context of the home setting, and resulting affective state within a free-living setting. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between context at home and adolescent sedentary time, and the relationship of sedentary time and subsequent affect. METHODS: Adolescents (n = 284; 10–16 y) participated in an EMA study that used random, interval-based sampling methods. Adolescents each received 22 unannounced surveys over 7-days through a smartphone application. One survey was randomly sent within each 2-h time-period. These time-periods occurred between 4:00 pm-8:00 pm on weekdays and 8:00 am-8:00 pm on the weekend. This 15-question survey included a series of questions on context (indoors/outdoors, alone/not alone) and positive affect. Adolescents concurrently wore an accelerometer at the hip, and the 30-min bout of accelerometry data prior to each survey was used in analyses. Mixed-effect location scale models were used to examine the association between context at home and sedentary time (stage 1) and the adjusted sedentary time and positive affect (stage 2), with each model adjusted for covariates. RESULTS: Adolescents were 12.6 ± 1.9 y of age on average, about half were White (58%), and engaged in high levels of sedentary behavior during the 30 min prior to the survey (21.4 ± 6.8 min). Most surveys occurred when adolescents were with others (59%) and indoors (88%). In Stage 1, both being alone and being indoors at home were positively associated with sedentary time (p < 0.001 for both). In Stage 2, adjusted sedentary time was not related to positive affect. Age was negatively related to positive affect (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Both contextual factors, being alone and indoors at home, were related to additional time spent sedentary compared to being with someone or outdoors. After adjustment, sedentary time was not related to subsequent positive affect, indicating other factors may be related to adolescent’s positive affect in home settings.

Many predictive tools developed to date are complex, rely on multiple blood results and past medical history, do not include chest X ray results and rely on Artificial Intelligence rather than simplified algorithms. Our aim was to develop a simplified risk-tool based on five parameters and CXR image data that predicts the 60-day survival of adult SARS CoV-2 positive patients at hospital admission. Methods We analysed the NCCID database of patient blood variables and CXR images from 19 hospitals across the UK contributed clinical data on SARS CoV-2 positive patients using multivariable logistic regression. The initial dataset was non-randomly split between development and internal validation dataset with 1434 and 310 SARS CoV-2 positive patients, respectively. External validation of final model conducted on 741 Accident and Emergency admissions with suspected SARS CoV-2 infection from a separate NHS Trust which was not part of the initial NCCID data set. Findings The LUCAS mortality score included five strongest predictors (lymphocyte count, urea, CRP, age, sex), which are available at any point of care with rapid turnaround of results. Our simple multivariable logistic model showed high discrimination for fatal outcome with the AUC-ROC in development cohort 0.765 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.738 - 0.790), in internal validation cohort 0.744 (CI: 0.673 - 0.808), and in external validation cohort 0.752 (CI: 0.713 - 0.787). The discriminatory power of LUCAS mortality score was increased slightly when including the CXR image data (for normal versus abnormal): internal validation AUC-ROC 0.770 (CI: 0.695 - 0.836) and external validation AUC-ROC 0.791 (CI: 0.746 - 0.833). The discriminatory power of LUCAS and LUCAS + CXR performed in the upper quartile of pre-existing risk stratification scores with the added advantage of using only 5 predictors. Interpretation This simplified prognostic tool derived from objective parameters can be used to obtain valid predictions of mortality in patients within 60 days SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR results.

We propose an alignment-free in silico approach for classifying SARS-CoV-2 variants based on their genomic sequences. A deep learning model was constructed utilizing a stacked 1-D convolutional neural network and multilayer perceptron (MLP). The pre-processed genomic sequencing data of the four SARS-CoV-2 variants were first fed to three stacked convolution-pooling nets to extract local linkage patterns in the sequences. Then a 2-layer MLP was used to compute the correlations between the input and output. Finally, a logistic regression model transformed the output and returned the probability values. Learning curves and stratified 10-fold cross-validation showed that the proposed classifier enables robust variant classification. External validation of the classifier showed an accuracy of 0.9962, precision of 0.9963, recall of 0.9963 and F1 score of 0.9962, outperforming other machine learning methods, including logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and random forest.

During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, worldwide healthcare system faced a new, insufficiently investigated, fast-spreading disease with multisystem failure and relatively high amount of severe diseased. Existing evidence base needs to be frequently revisited after data accumulation and analysis. Experience of dedicated COVID-19 centers should be summarized and implicated in clinical practice according to evidence-based principles, extensive clinical trial initiation. Objectives. To investigate baseline characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection course, requiring respiratory support in the critical care settings of dedicated hospital. Materials and methods. In single-center retrospective study retrospective data collection of 451 respiratory support for COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome cases (noninvasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation) in intensive care unit patients for a 5-month period performed. The analysis aimed on demographic, clinical data, disease severity scores, respiratory support parameters and modality, continuous renal replacement therapy utilization and interleukin-6 receptor blockers administration, survival rates. Results. Respiratory support required 48.8 % of intensive care unit patients, the population was demographically balanced, Charlson Comorbidity Index was 4.46 ± 2.6 and was higher in the mechanically ventilated group. 30-day survival rate (all respiratory support cases) was 33.7 %, mortality structure analysis performed. The disease severity scores, respiratory mechanics among patients in dependence of respiratory support mode and during the period of case registration analysed as well. Median static respiratory compliance at the point of initiation of invasive mechanically ventilation was 43 (IQR 35–51). Mortality in the volume controlled mechanically ventilated group was higher. Conclusions. The patients, requiring respiratory support, during intensive care unit stay have high comorbidity levels. Indications for non-invasive ventilation may be extended on patients with lower Charlson index and initial SOFA score, however, early recognition of high risk of noninvasive ventilation failure required. Volume control invasive ventilation associated with higher mortality levels despite comparable disease severity scores.

A retrospective study,10.23750/abm.v91i3.10218,PMC7716996,32921707,cc-by-nc-sa,"BACKGROUND: In Italy, one of the country most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the first autochthonous case appeared in Lombardy on February 20th, 2020. One month later, the number of COVID-19 patients in Lombardy exceeded 17000 and about 3500 had died. Because of this rapid increase in infected people scientists wonder whether SARS-CoV-2 was already highly circulating in Lombardy before such date. Plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were shown to be highly increased in COVID-19 patients. Monitoring their levels in Emergency Room patients during the months preceding February 20th, 2020, might shade light on the prevalence of the disease in the pre-COVID-19 period. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the AST and LDH levels from more than 30.000 patients admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital Emergency Room (ER) between September 2019 and May 2020 as well as between September 2018 and May 2019. The number of patients diagnosed with respiratory tract diseases were also analyzed. RESULTS: Data showed that the ER averaged AST and LDH levels are highly sensitive to the presence of COVID-19 patients. During, the months preceding February 20th, 2020, AST and LDH levels, as well as the number of patients diagnosed with respiratory tract diseases were similar to their 2019 counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: No significant evidence showing that a large number of COVID-19 patients were admitted to the San Raffaele Hospital ER before February 20th, 2020, was found. Thus, the virus was likely circulating, within the Hospital catchment area, either in low amounts or through asymptomatic individuals. Because of the high LDH and AST levels’ variations induced by COVID-19, routine blood tests might be exploited as a surveillance indicator for a possible second wave.",2020-09-07,"Ferrari, Davide; Cabitza, Federico; Carobene, Anna; Locatelli, Massimo",Acta Biomed,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/f4055162a52bce963c9affdc31d948e1c5d3cbf3.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7716996.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32921707/; https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i3.10218,221671713.0

kr27ryxb,,PMC,Effects of a School-Based Physical Activity Intervention for Obesity and Health-Related Physical Fitness in Adolescents With Intellectual Disability: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,10.2196/25838,PMC8088867,33749611,cc-by,"BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity accompanied by lower levels of health-related physical fitness (HRPF) is a major threat to public health both internationally and locally. Children with intellectual disability, especially adolescents, have a higher risk of being overweight/obese and having poor HRPF levels. Therefore, more interventions are needed to help this population attain their optimal health levels. However, there has been relatively limited research on this population compared with on their typically developing peers. OBJECTIVE: The proposed study aims to fill this knowledge gap by developing and examining the success of a physical activity (PA) intervention for the target population. METHODS: The proposed study will be a 12-week, school-based randomized controlled trial. The participants (N=48) will be recruited from special schools for students with mild intellectual disability and then randomly allocated to either the intervention group (IG) or the wait-list control group (CG). During the intervention period, the participants in the IG will receive a fun game–based moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) training program (2 sessions/week, 60 minutes/session, for a total of 24 sessions). The intensity of the activities will increase in a progressive manner. Participants in the CG will receive no program during the study period, but the same PA program will be provided to them after the completion of the study. To observe and evaluate the sustaining effects of the intervention, follow-up testing will be scheduled for the participants 12 weeks after the intervention concludes. The study outcomes will include primary outcomes (obesity- and fitness-related outcomes) and a secondary outcome (blood pressure). All of the measurements will be taken at 3 time points. After the follow-up tests, the same PA training program will be provided to the participants in the CG. RESULTS: This study is ongoing. The participants were recruited from October 2020 to November 2020. The total duration of the study is 13 months. Study results are expected at the end of 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed study is expected to reduce obesity and improve HRPF levels in children with intellectual disability. If proven effective, the intervention will be made accessible to more special schools and mainstream schools with students with intellectual disability. Furthermore, the study can serve as an example for international researchers, policy makers, and members of the public who are seeking to tackle the problem of obesity and poor HRPF among children with intellectual disability.

bi1gwoj8,,WHO,Tracking the emergence of disparities in the subnational spread of COVID-19 in Brazil using an online application for real-time data visualisation: A longitudinal analysis,,,,unk,"Background Brazil is one of the countries worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with over 20 million cases and 557,000 deaths reported by August 2021. Comparison of real-time local COVID-19 data between areas is essential for understanding transmission, measuring the effects of interventions, and predicting the course of the epidemic, but are often challenging due to different population sizes and structures. Methods We describe the development of a new app for the real-time visualisation of COVID-19 data in Brazil at the municipality level. In the CLIC-Brazil app, daily updates of case and death data are downloaded, age standardised and used to estimate the effective reproduction number (Rt). We show how such platforms can perform real-time regression analyses to identify factors associated with the rate of initial spread and early reproduction number. We also use survival methods to predict the likelihood of occurrence of a new peak of COVID-19 incidence. Findings After an initial introduction in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states in early March 2020, the epidemic spread to northern states and then to highly populated coastal regions and the Central-West. Municipalities with higher metrics of social development experienced earlier arrival of COVID-19 (decrease of 11·1 days [95% CI:8.9,13.2] in the time to arrival for each 10% increase in the social development index). Differences in the initial epidemic intensity (mean Rt) were largely driven by geographic location and the date of local onset. Interpretation This study demonstrates that platforms that monitor, standardise and analyse the epidemiological data at a local level can give useful real-time insights into outbreak dynamics that can be used to better adapt responses to the current and future pandemics.

Social restrictions aimed at flattening the curve may be associated with an increase in stress and anxiety, which may increase the use of alcohol as a coping mechanism. The objective of this study was to examine if stress and anxiety were associated with changes in alcohol use in a sample of adult twins. Twins allowed us to control for genetic and shared environmental factors that would confound the alcohol - mental health relationship. Twins (N = 3,971; 909 same-sex pairs) from the Washington State Twin Registry (WSTR) completed an online survey examining several health-related behaviors and outcomes and their self-reported changes due to COVID-19. About 14% of the respondents reported an increase in alcohol use. We found an association between both stress and anxiety and increased alcohol use, where twins with higher levels of stress and anxiety were more likely to report an increase in alcohol consumption. The associations were small and confounded by between-family factors and demographic characteristics. However, there was no significant difference in stress or anxiety levels between non-drinkers and those who reported no change in alcohol use.

A proportionate mixing model reduced the overall HIT, but more realistic levels of assortative mixing increased the threshold. Across all models, the burden of infection fell disproportionately on minority populations: in an assortative mixing model fit to Long Island census data, 80% of Hispanics or Latinos were infected when the HIT is reached compared to 33% of non-Hispanic whites.

Various agents, coils and plug, have been used to minimize this risk, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. This study reports the results of coagulation using thermal-ablation (radiofrequency or microwave ablation) as an alternative to trans-hepatic puncture tract closure. Methods Ten patients who benefited from portal vein recanalization or portal hypertension-relative bleeding complication embolization using percutaneous portal vein access and who underwent thermal-ablation of the puncture tract between December 30, 2019 and July 16, 2020 were included. Early efficiency and safety were evaluated using imaging (ultrasound and/or CT scan) and laboratory data (hemoglobin, hepatic function) at 24 h. Follow-up was performed until August 2020. Results No bleeding from the puncture tract and no embolization-related complications were observed in all 10 patients at 24 h or during follow-up with median of 3 months (range 1-8 months), even in case of ascites or therapeutic coagulation.

STUDY DESIGN: The medical records of 2681 patients who had undergone surgical treatment of ovarian endometrioma between January 2008 and September 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into AE (n = 86) and TE (n = 2595) groups. Patients’ characteristics and recurrence rates were evaluated and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The mean size of ovarian cysts was significantly larger in the AE group (7.6 ± 3.5 cm vs 6.7 ± 3.3 cm, p = 0.01) and the proportion of nulliparous women was significantly lower in AE group (65.1 % vs 77.8 %, p = 0.008). Otherwise, there were no statistically significant differences in patient characteristics between the two groups. After Cox regression analyses with IPTW was adjusted, the risk factors for recurrent endometrioma were higher preoperative CA125 level >48 U/mL (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.741; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1.517−4.952; p < 0.001), multilocular cyst (HR = 1.909; 95 % CI = 1.128−3.230; p = 0.016), and atypical endometriosis (HR = 2.666; 95 % CI = 1.659−4.284; p < 0.001). The AE group displayed a significantly higher cumulative recurrence rate than the TE group (p = 0.0057, log-rank test). No patients were diagnosed with atypical endometriosis to malignant transformation during the follow-up periods. However, two typical endometriosis patients experienced borderline malignancy and serous carcinoma, respectively. CONCLUSION: Recurrence rates for AE were higher than for TE.

Among healthcare workers vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, a survey was conducted to analyze the relationship between the incidence and severity of adverse reactions after vaccination. METHODS: We conducted a prospective self-reported survey of adverse reactions among healthcare workers vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty®) in Japan. After the first and second dose of vaccine, local and systemic reactions for 8 days after vaccination were reported by volunteer participants using a website. After receiving vaccination, 374 respondents participated in this matched-pair study. RESULTS: Both the incidence and severity of adverse reactions tended to be higher after the second vaccine dose than after the first dose. However, the incidence and numeric rating scale (NRS) score of muscle and skin pain were nearly the same after the first and second doses. In a comparison by sex, women had significantly higher incidence and NRS scores for adverse reactions such as headache, skin pain, erythema, and itching. The results also showed that younger age groups had higher incidence rates and NRS scores for all adverse reactions investigated, except for muscle pain, compared with older age groups.

itdjzys3,,WHO,Patient preferences for health information technologies: A systematic review,10.21037/jhmhp-20-105,,,unk,"Background: Advances in patient-facing health information technology (HIT) promise to improve health care delivery and patient outcomes. Low utilization of HIT suggests that the preferences of patients may not be adequately guiding the development of these technologies. This systematic review offers an assessment of published evidence regarding patient preferences for HIT. Methods: Articles addressing preferences for HIT from patient and other end-user groups published up through 2020 were identified from PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and via hand searching. Articles that used quantitative stated-preference methods to explore preferences for HIT were eligible for inclusion. Studies that explored attitudes towards HIT without eliciting trade-offs were excluded. Critical appraisal of study quality was conducted using the PREFS checklist and quality criteria identified by the US Food and Drug Administration including heterogeneity analysis and patient engagement in study design. We conducted thematic analysis of the main preference findings from each study to synthesize patient and enduser preferences for HIT. The review was not registered and authors received no funding to conduct the review. Results: The search yielded 7,299 unique articles, 59 of which were ultimately included in the review. Studies explored preferences for telemedicine (n=30), patient portals (n=12), mHealth (n=9) or multiple HITs (n=8). Preference elicitation methods included direct elicitation (n=26), discrete-choice experiments (n=13), conjoint analysis (n=6), contingent valuation (n=5), and ranking exercises (n=9). Studies had a mean PREFS score of 3.51 out of 5. Forty-two studies conducted preference heterogeneity analysis and only 20 included patients in study design. Thematic meta-analysis indicated that patients prefer HIT that is convenient and lower cost, but does not sacrifice quality, and preferences varied by demographic features such as age as well as depending on the type of health information being communicated. Conclusions: Patient and end-users have distinct preferences for the use of HIT in their medical care. It is timely that researchers and healthcare administrators consider these preferences for HIT given its rapid uptake amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Although this literature demonstrates that patients can be engaged as participants in preference studies to identify meaningful aspects of HIT, the field was limited in its inclusion of patients in the design of such studies. Future development of HIT should be guided by high-quality preference research that integrates patients in all stages in the design and implementation of HIT. © Journal of Hospital Management and Health Policy.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study with 511 respondents and a follow-up study 4 months later on 422 respondents completing an online survey measuring demographic factors, media consumption, self-assessed health, experience with the disease, health anxiety, COVID-19 threat, worries and cognitive and emotional illness representations. RESULTS: Health anxiety, media consumption, female gender, lower self-assessed health, knowing a deceased COVID-19 patient and being infected explained variance in threat appraisal. Worries represented 2 factors: psychosocial and existential. Threat appraisal and worries explained variance in illness representations. Representations of the disease worsened and started stabilizing over time. Emotional representations were exceptionally stable and explainable by threat appraisals.

Initial studies reported ischemic strokes primarily occurring in the critically ill COVID-19 population. However, there have been reports of ischemic strokes as the presenting symptom in young non-critically ill COVID-19 patients without significant risk factors. Further characterization of the COVID-19 stroke population is needed. We present four cases of COVID-19 ischemic strokes occurring in patients 37 to 68 years of age with varying COVID-19 infection severities, premorbid risk factors, clinical presentations (e.g. focal and non-focal), and vascular distributions. These cases highlight the heterogeneity of COVID-19 ischemic strokes. The duration of the COVID-19 related prothrombotic state is unknown and it is unclear if patients are at risk for recurrent strokes. With more COVID-19 patients recovering and being discharged to rehabilitation, physiatric awareness of this prothrombotic state and increased incidence of ischemic strokes is essential. Due to the variable presentation of COVID-19 ischemic strokes, clinicians can consider neuroimaging as part of the evaluation in COVID-19 patients with either acute focal or non-focal neurologic symptoms.

These results define both body-wide and tissue-specific (heart, liver, lung, kidney, and lymph nodes) damage wrought by the SARS-CoV-2 infection, evident as a function of varying viral load (high vs. low) during the course of infection and specific, transcriptional dysregulation in splicing isoforms, T cell receptor expression, and cellular expression states. In particular, cardiac and lung tissues revealed the largest degree of splicing isoform switching and cell expression state loss.

The number of surveillance scans and the use of GBCAs in surveillance of low-risk tumours should ideally be limited. We aimed to investigate the consistency and utility of our surveillance imaging and also determine to what extent the use of GBCAs contributed to decisions to escalate treatment in children with grade 1 astrocytomas. METHODS: This was a retrospective single-centre study at a tertiary paediatric hospital. All children with a new diagnosis of a non-syndromic World Health Organization (WHO) grade 1 astrocytoma between 2007 and 2013 were included, with surveillance imaging up to December 2018 included in analysis. The intervals of surveillance imaging were recorded, and imaging and electronic health records were examined for decisions related to treatment escalation. RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients had 690 surveillance scans in the study period. Thirty-one patients had recurrence or progression leading to treatment escalation, 30 of whom were identified on surveillance imaging. The use of GBCAs did not appear to contribute to multidisciplinary team (MDT) decisions in the majority of cases. CONCLUSION: Surveillance imaging could be reduced in number and duration for completely resected cerebellar tumours. MDT decisions were rarely made on the basis of post-contrast imaging, and GBCA administration could therefore potentially be restricted in the setting of surveillance of grade 1 astrocytomas in children.",2020-11-25,"Campion, Tom; Quirk, Bernadine; Cooper, Jessica; Phipps, Kim; Toescu, Sebastian; Aquilina, Kristian; Green, Katherine; Hargrave, Darren; Mankad, Kshitij",Neuroradiology,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/83bb1133866e7c0dd98ca9ba29cc9ee8136225d0.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7688203.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-020-02609-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33241451/,227165182.0

Over 82% of HHC patients are 65 and older, and living with chronic health conditions. In an effort to respond to the risk the COVID-19 pandemic presented for patients, a HHC agency designed “The Outreach Phone Call Project”. This program was developed to provide telephone support to at-risk patients who had received HHC prior to the COVID-19 lockdown. In total, 16 Care Transition Managers participated in the project and over 4,000 patients received a call from the clinical team. Approximately 44% of the calls did not require any further follow up, 20% of the patients did not answer the call, and 3% of patients were referred back to HHC. Another 13% needed education and assistance with social issues. The calls provided a means of safe connection and support between providers and patients during the pandemic and facilitated access to health and social resources. However, the most beneficial aspect of the program was the opportunity for seasoned HHC nurses to identify clinical changes in the health of patients and to assist them in the triage process. Results of this study demonstrate that the implementation of a calling project during the pandemic shutdown provided invaluable connection and outreach to vulnerable populations. This simple change in practice enabled HHC professionals to reach patients who were isolated and in need of education and assistance.

Guidelines to manage post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia are available for adults, but not children. The objective of this review was to identify practices related to hypocalcemia prevention and management in pediatric patients. METHODS We identified studies examining the prevention and management of hypocalcemia in pediatric patients post-thyroidectomy within PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane databases. Three independent reviewers screened citations and reviewed full-text papers. RESULTS A total of 15 studies were included, representing 1552 patients. The overall study quality was weak with lack of randomization and inconsistent outcome reporting. The pooled incidence of hypocalcemia from the 15 studies was 35.5% for transient hypocalcemia and 4.2% for permanent hypocalcemia. All studies discussed post-operative hypocalcemia treatment, with most patients requiring admission for intra-venous calcium therapy. One study described a protocol discharging asymptomatic patients on calcitriol and calcium. Three studies discussed preoperative calcium supplementation in patients at risk of hypocalcemia. No studies examined routine use of calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation to prevent post-operative hypocalcemia. CONCLUSION A significant number of children undergoing thyroidectomy develop hypocalcemia.

Beyond just tracking patient progress, PROs facilitate patient-provider communication and can be used to inform care practices. Though recent studies have focused on the merits of PRO collection in orthopaedics, few have sought to understand the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on PRO collection. Our objective is to review the initialization of an electronic PRO collection platform at our Orthopaedic Sports Medicine clinics and surgery center before and during the coronavirus pandemic. We focus specifically on our first 7,557 patients in a retrospective study and the interplay between our collection tactics and the patients’ responses to PROs from November 2019 to July 2020. METHODS: Starting in the fall of 2019, we implemented a new clinic-wide data capturing system to collect PROs and maintain our outcomes database. We began with a small group of providers and their patients before expanding to include most providers and staff in three clinics. Patients received the following forms prior to their first visit: Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain Interference, PROMIS Physical Function, and subsequent corresponding anatomic-specific scales. The Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) was later added in the spring of 2020. A secure link to the surveys was sent to the patient’s email or phone prior to their appointment or accessed via an iPad at the clinic’s kiosk during their appointment. However, due to coronavirus cleaning protocols, forms were only sent to the patient’s email or phone beginning in March. Upon completion of July 2020 collection, we utilized STATA statistical software to analyze the data and identify trends in patient responses. For statistical analysis, we used chi-squared tests. RESULTS: For the purpose of this study, we collected PROs from 7,557 patients between November 2019 and July 2020. After analyzing all data points in STATA, we determined differences in several collection categories, including the extent of completion and time of completion. Out of all patients prompted to complete one or more PROs, 37.20% of patients (n = 2811) did not complete any PROs, 11.86% of patients (n = 896) completed some but not all assigned PROs, and 50.95% of patients (n = 3850) completed all assigned PROs. Patients who completed all or some of their PROs completed them before their appointment 56.02% of the time (n = 2773), within an hour of their appointment 35.49% of the time (n = 1757), and after their appointment 8.48% of the time (n = 420) (see Figure 1). After separating PRO completion rates by month, we noticed a shift in compliance and patient response patterns before and during the coronavirus pandemic. From November to February, the average number of patients who completed one or more PROs was 80.20% (n = 1797) before dropping to an average of 57.74% (n = 5760; p <0.001) between March and July. The overall PRO compliance rate similarly dropped at our first PRO collection site, Clinic A, from an average of 86.75% to 76.81%, respectively (see Figure 2). Clinic operations were significantly reduced in late March due to the coronavirus pandemic, leading to majority telehealth visits and restrictions on clinic-wide shared iPad use. Though more than half of patients on average completed their PROs prior to their appointment throughout the year, this trend was especially prevalent during the coronavirus pandemic. For all or some PROs completed prior to appointment time, 42.34% were completed on average between November and February compared to 62.42% between March and July (see Figure 3). Beyond completion metrics, we observed a difference in appointment cancellations before and during the coronavirus pandemic. From November to February, 21.28% of patient appointments were canceled on average compared to 35.74% of appointments canceled on average from March to July. The number of cancelations during the coronavirus pandemic was significantly different than before the pandemic (p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In a short period of time (9 months) after initial implementation of a PRO platform, our practice has amassed significant data and reported outcomes for over 7,000 patients. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, patients were relatively receptive to the new PRO collection platform with over 80% of patients completing some or all assigned PROs. However, following our clinic-wide cessation of shared iPads due to coronavirus concerns, we noted a significant decrease in our patient compliance (80.20% down to 57.74%; p <0.001). Though discontinuation of iPad and kiosk use likely only contributed in part to this significant decrease, this observation still suggests that shared devices may play an important role in promoting PRO compliance within the clinic. It’s also important to note the limitations in this study, including the staggered integration of each provider’s patients. This likely impacted the increased compliance rates in November with 282 patients versus 1677 patients in July. In addition, compliance may have been affected by the transition from two research staff members helping collect PROs to one research staff member. Methods of promoting compliance also changed as we shifted to telehealth visits. In March and April, members of our research team called patients about their incomplete PROs, likely prompting increased responses prior to patient appointments. We are utilizing these observations to improve our workflow for collecting patient PROs and increase compliance within the clinic. After reflecting on our initial findings, we feel the use of devices in clinic and full staff involvement can bolster completion of PROs and are important tools in order to best maintain a data collection platform with high patient compliance.",2021-10-29,"Barnds, Brandon; Witt, Atlee; Orahovats, Alexanda; Schlegel, Theodore; Hunt, Kenneth",Orthop J Sports Med,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1177/2325967121s00256,240309770.0

ResultsResearch samples included 1222 participants. 99.2% of participants were aware of respiratory transmission of COVID-19, and 75.6% also believed fecal-oral transmission to be possible. Although 98.3% of participants reported knowing how to properly wear and remove masks, most parents were unaware of good handwashing technique and answered incorrectly regarding cough etiquette. Research participants seemed uncertain of children’s symptoms. Awareness scores of participants significantly differed across parental role, educational attainment levels, and social-economic levels (P<0.005), with fathers, the better educated, and those of higher income showing higher levels of awareness.

METHODS Five eligible patients with node-negative rectal cancer located 4-12 cm from the anal verge were enrolled in an IRB-approved pilot study. All patients underwent transanal endoscopic TME with laparoscopic assistance, hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis, and a diverting loop ileostomy. Primary and secondary end points included adequacy of the mesorectal excision and 30-day postoperative complications, respectively. RESULTS Between November 2011 and May 2012, three males and two females underwent transanal endoscopic TME with laparoscopic assistance. Patient mean age and BMI were 48.6 ± 9.8 years and 25.7 ± 2.3 kg/m(2), respectively. Tumors were located an average of 5.7 ± 2.4 cm from the anal verge and preoperatively staged as T1N0M0 (2), T2N0M0 (1), and T3N0M0 (2). Mean operative time was 274.6 ± 85.4 min with no intraoperative complications. Partial intersphincteric resection was performed in conjunction with transanal endoscopic TME in three patients. Pathologic examination of TME specimens demonstrated complete mesorectal excision in all cases with negative proximal, distal, and radial margins. Mean length of hospital stay was 5.2 ± 2.6 days and three minor complications occurred, including one ileus and two cases of transient urinary dysfunction. At a mean early follow-up of 5.4 ± 2.3 months, all patients remain disease-free. CONCLUSIONS In this pilot study of five patients with rectal cancer, transanal endoscopic TME with laparoscopic assistance is feasible and safe, and is a promising alternative to open and laparoscopic TME.

While, naturally acquired human RH5 antibodies have been functionally characterized, there are no similar reports on CyRPA. Thus, we analyzed the parasite neutralizing activity of naturally acquired human CyRPA antibodies. In this regard, CyRPA human antibodies were measured and purified from malaria infected sera obtained from central India and analyzed for their parasite neutralizing activity in in vitro growth inhibition assays (GIA). We report that despite being susceptible to antibody, CyRPA being a highly conserved antigen does not appear to be under substantial immune selection pressure as a very low acquisition of anti-CyRPA antibodies was reported in malaria-exposed Indians. We demonstrate for the first time that the low amounts of natural CyRPA antibodies exhibited functional parasite-neutralizing activity and that a CyRPA based vaccine formulation induces highly potent antibodies in rabbits. Importantly, the vaccine induced CyRPA antibodies exhibited a robust IC50 of 21.96 μg/ml that is comparable to IC50 of antibodies against the leading blood stage vaccine candidate, RH5.

The objectives of this study were to determine the early and dynamic alterations of Th1 and Th2 populations to community-acquired severe sepsis upon onset among previously immunocompetent patients and whether it was related to clinical outcomes. METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study was conducted at a general intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary teaching hospital in China. Immunocompetent patients with community-acquired severe sepsis within 24 h upon onset were included as septic group. Healthy volunteers and critically ill patients without severe sepsis were recruited as controls. Whole blood was collected on D0, 3rd day (D3) and 7th day (D7) for septic group and once upon enrollment for controls. Th1 and Th2 populations were measured by flow cytometry and assessed for associations with 28-day mortality using cox proportional hazard models. Associations of dynamic alterations of Th cell subpopulations with clinical outcomes were investigated. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that community-acquired severe sepsis patients (n = 71) had increased Th2/Th1 and Th2 populations, compared to healthy controls (n = 7) and critically ill patients without severe sepsis (n = 7) at admission. Among the septic cohort, values of Th2/Th1 were significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors on D0 (p = 0.04), D3 (p < 0.001) and D7 (p < 0.001). Patients with persistently increasing Th2/Th1 demonstrated the highest mortality (47.1%) and incidence of ICU-acquired infections (64.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Th2/Th1 was markedly up-regulated with Th2 dominance upon community-acquired severe sepsis onset among previously immunocompetent patients and its persistently dynamic increase was associated with ICU-acquired infections and 28-day death.

In addition to anxiety related to infection risks, trainees have the additional burden of learning and career planning while providing care in an uncertain and rapidly changing environment. We conducted a survey to evaluate the practical and psychosocial impact on radiation oncology fellows during the first month of the pandemic. Methods and Materials: A 4-part survey was designed and distributed to the fellows in our program. The survey was designed to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on scope of activity and well-being (""Impact on You"") and to identify key lessons learned and social factors (""About You"") using Likert scales and open-ended response options. The survey included items from the Oldenburg Burnout questionnaire. Results: A total of 17 participants (71%) responded to the survey. Although there was a significant reduction in the mean time spent on in-person clinics (13.5 h/wk [pre-COVID] vs 9.3 h/wk [3 weeks into the COVID emergency response]; P = .002), this was replaced by virtual consults and other COVID-related activities. The proportion of respondents demonstrating features of burnout in the domains of ""disengagement"" and ""exhaustion"" was 71% and 64%, respectively. However, there was also evidence of resilience, with 47% respondents ""feeling energized."" Top ""concerns"" and ""negative changes"" identified related to learning, infection risk and safety, patient care, coping, and concerns about their home country. Top ""positive changes"" highlighted include work culture, appreciation for leadership caring for the team, the insistence on evidence to guide change, and the implementation of virtual health care.

Even if important improvements have been achieved worldwide, traffic, industrial activities, and the energy sector are mostly responsible for NOx and SOx release; instead, the agricultural sector is mainly responsible for NH(3) emissions. Due to the emergency of coronavirus disease, in Italy schools and universities have been locked down from late February 2020, followed in March by almost all production and industrial activities as well as road transport, except for the agricultural ones. This study aims to analyze NH(3), PM(2.5) and NOx emissions in principal livestock provinces in the Lombardy region (Brescia, Cremona, Lodi, and Mantua) to evaluate if and how air emissions have changed during this quarantine period respect to 2016-2019. For each province, meteorological and air quality data were collected from the database of the Regional Agency for the Protection of the Environment, considering both data stations located in the city and the countryside. In the 2020 selected period, PM(2.5) reduction was higher compared to the previous years, especially in February and March. Respect to February, PM(2.5) released in March in the city stations reduced by 19%-32% in 2016-2019 and by 21%-41% in 2020. Similarly, NOx data of 2020 were lower than in the 2016-2019 period (reduction in March respect to February of 22-42% for 2016-2019 and of 43-62% for 2020); in particular, this can be observed in city stations, because of the current reduction in anthropogenic emissions related to traffic and industrial activities. A different trend with no reductions was observed for NH(3) emissions, as agricultural activities have not stopped during the lockdown. Air quality is affected by many variables, for which making conclusions requires a holistic perspective.

Different categories of community quarantine and granular lockdowns have since been imposed to curb the spread of the virus. An online survey was distributed to analyze socio-demographic characteristics and reasons for traveling in relation to weekly trip frequency before and during pandemic. These are presented and analyzed through data visualization and multinomial logistic regression. Results show that the major reason for traveling before pandemic was work-related but has since shifted to buying essentials or for leisure or recreation. Weekly trip frequencies were lesser when compared before pandemic, but several socio-demographic groups have shown otherwise. There is statistical significance for those less likely to travel when commuters are employed, self-employed or students compared to unemployed, earning PHP 10,000 or less compared to those earning above PHP 50,000, in a household size of 10 compared to all other household sizes, and those with college degree against elementary or no formal education. By determining the travel behavior of commuters when they have ample time to adjust to the new normal, their mobility needs can be best understood and consequently satisfied.

Zoonosis can occur not only through direct transmission from vertebrates to humans, but also through intermediate reservoirs or other environmental factors. Viruses can be categorized according to genotype (ssDNA, dsDNA, ssRNA and dsRNA viruses). Among them, the RNA viruses exhibit particularly high mutation rates and are especially problematic for this reason. Most zoonotic viruses are RNA viruses that change their envelope proteins to facilitate binding to various receptors of host species. In this study, we sought to predict zoonotic propensity through the analysis of receptor characteristics. We hypothesized that the major barrier to interspecies virus transmission is that receptor sequences vary among species--in other words, that the specific amino acid sequence of the receptor determines the ability of the viral envelope protein to attach to the cell. RESULTS: We analysed host-cell receptor sequences for their hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity characteristics. We then analysed these properties for similarities among receptors of different species and used a statistical discriminant analysis to predict the likelihood of transmission among species. CONCLUSIONS: This study is an attempt to predict zoonosis through simple computational analysis of receptor sequence differences.

Certain key histopathological features such as the presence of a moderate degree of spongiosis, extensive basal cell damage with multiple necrotic keratinocytes and dermal infiltrate rich in eosinophils or lymphocytes and histiocytes may favor a drug exanthem, while distinctive epidermal cytopathic changes and lymphocytic vasculitis point towards a viral etiology. Similarly, notable immunohistochemical markers such as IL-5, eotaxin and FAS ligand may support a diagnosis of a drug-induced maculopapular eruption.

riajkuln,,WHO,COVID-19 in India: Statewise Analysis and Prediction,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: The highly infectious coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and subsequently spread to 212 countries and territories around the world, infecting millions of people. In India, a large country of about 1.3 billion people, the disease was first detected on January 30, 2020, in a student returning from Wuhan. The total number of confirmed infections in India as of May 3, 2020, is more than 37,000 and is currently growing fast. OBJECTIVE: Most of the prior research and media coverage focused on the number of infections in the entire country. However, given the size and diversity of India, it is important to look at the spread of the disease in each state separately, wherein the situations are quite different. In this paper, we aim to analyze data on the number of infected people in each Indian state (restricted to only those states with enough data for prediction) and predict the number of infections for that state in the next 30 days. We hope that such statewise predictions would help the state governments better channelize their limited health care resources. METHODS: Since predictions from any one model can potentially be misleading, we considered three growth models, namely, the logistic, the exponential, and the susceptible-infectious-susceptible models, and finally developed a data-driven ensemble of predictions from the logistic and the exponential models using functions of the model-free maximum daily infection rate (DIR) over the last 2 weeks (a measure of recent trend) as weights. The DIR is used to measure the success of the nationwide lockdown. We jointly interpreted the results from all models along with the recent DIR values for each state and categorized the states as severe, moderate, or controlled. RESULTS: We found that 7 states, namely, Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal are in the severe category. Among the remaining states, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Punjab, and Bihar are in the moderate category, whereas Kerala, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, and Telangana are in the controlled category. We also tabulated actual predicted numbers from various models for each state. All the R2 values corresponding to the logistic and the exponential models are above 0.90, indicating a reasonable goodness of fit. We also provide a web application to see the forecast based on recent data that is updated regularly. CONCLUSIONS: States with nondecreasing DIR values need to immediately ramp up the preventive measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, the states with decreasing DIR can maintain the same status to see the DIR slowly become zero or negative for a consecutive 14 days to be able to declare the end of the pandemic.",2020,"Ghosh, Palash; Ghosh, Rik; Chakraborty, Bibhas",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,#999971,,,,,221077538.0

The lockdown measures implemented in India to combat COVID-19 rendered significant economic costs in terms of loss of employment, income, and output. In this paper, we find that the national lockdown measures adopted by the GOI have weakened the states financially, making them financially more dependent on the centre. This paper argues that the interests of domestic capitalists and international finance capital have restricted India from increasing its government expenditure and adopting economic policies for the best benefits of its citizens. Thus, financial weakness of the state governments has accentuated during the lockdown period and has tilted the balance further in favour of the centre. This is neither encouraging from the perspective of fiscal federalism in India nor for the delivery of welfare to its citizens. This may even delay the process of India’s economic recovery.

TikTok posts may both reflect and shape young people's perceptions of the pandemic. This mixed methods study applied a uses and gratifications framework to a systematic analysis of trending TikToks related to COVID-19, with attention to changes over a 2-month period. METHODS Analyses are based on an original data set of 2,675 TikToks (529 unique videos across 68 COVID-relevant hashtags) viewed over 2,840,347,014 times. TikToks were tracked daily for 65 days after the beginning of U.S. stay-at-home orders (March 17 to May 20, 2020). A thematic analysis used 28 content codes and nine codes related to subject(s) to examine content patterns. Chi-square tests facilitated analyses of changes over time. RESULTS Trending TikToks related to COVID-19 most often featured details of everyday circumstances and/or relatable commentary on Pandemic Life. These posts were similarly prevalent in Months 1 and 2. Health-Promoting TikToks outnumbered those exhibiting Risky or Concerning Health Practices (58:13) and were more common in Month 1. Advertisements and sponsored campaigns also shaped trending COVID-relevant content during the study period. CONCLUSIONS On TikTok, public health information appears to coexist with an abundance of commentary about everyday life during the pandemic. Posts arguably reflect documented social media use goals such as information seeking/sharing, archiving, and self-expression. Yet, TikToks during the pandemic period perhaps most often connect to another previously undocumented use goal: a digital search for common humanity in seeing difficult experiences as part of a larger human experience.",2021-04-03,"Unni, Zoya; Weinstein, Emily",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.02.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33824071/,233173229.0

The goal of this study was to identify genetic features unique to KM22 by comparing the genome sequence of KM22 to the laboratory reference strain RB50. To gain a broader perspective of the genetic relationship of KM22 among other B. bronchiseptica strains, selected genes of KM22 were then compared to five other B. bronchiseptica strains isolated from different hosts. Overall, the KM22 genome sequence is more similar to the genome sequences of the strains isolated from animals than the strains isolated from humans. The majority of virulence gene expression in Bordetella is positively regulated by the two-component sensory transduction system BvgAS. bopN, bvgA, fimB, and fimC were the most highly conserved BvgAS-regulated genes present in all seven strains analyzed. In contrast, the BvgAS-regulated genes present in all seven strains with the highest sequence divergence werefimN, fim2, fhaL, andfhaS. A total of eight major fimbrial subunit genes were identified in KM22. Quantitative real-time PCR data demonstrated that seven of the eight fimbrial subunit genes identified in KM22 are expressed and regulated by BvgAS. The annotation of the KM22 genome sequence, coupled with the comparative genomic analyses reported in this study, can be used to facilitate the development of vaccines with improved efficacy towards B. bronchiseptica in swine to decrease the prevalence and disease burden caused by this pathogen.",2016-01-15,"Nicholson, Tracy L.; Shore, Sarah M.; Register, Karen B.; Bayles, Darrell O.; Kingsley, Robert A.; Brunelle, Brian W.",Vet Microbiol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/1bf6de18aec2c9d092d17543fba178914aca2cfa.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7117204.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.10.026; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113515300675; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113515300675; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26711033/,22717191.0

Recent evidence points to the important role of reward in SNS behaviours and one avenue to examine reward processes related to SNSs is the use of behavioural paradigms that allow for the measurement of implicit motivational responses, such as the approach avoidance task (AAT). The AAT has been successfully utilised to capture changes in unconscious reward processes in substance use disorders and other behavioural addictions, with faster approach reactions to addiction-related stimuli reflecting increased wanting/urges to have/consume the reward. In the present study 411 young adults completed an online Visual Approach/Avoidance by the Self Task (VAAST) with social media and control logos as well as other subjective (explicit) measures of reward experience related to SNSs. Our results showed that across participants SNS logos elicited strong approach reactions (compared to control stimuli) and that stronger SNS approach tendencies predicted more frequent SNS checking. Importantly, increased approach motivation was not associated with more problematic use. However, both checking frequency and problematic use were related to alterations of explicit reward processing, including the subjective experience of SNS urges or wanting. We conclude that changes in automatic approach motivation towards SNS stimuli are common in most SNS users, which suggests that implicit imbuement of social media with reward has become pervasive among young adults. Problematic SNS use however may be more reliably indicated by changes in explicit reward processing, such as subjective wanting.",2022-03-16,"Wadsley, Michael; Ihssen, Niklas",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e5093c157e4ec0e24eb80a34317c07e6c3271b0e.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8926255.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35294452/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264738,247498518.0

The main motive of this proposal is to reduce the human resources, improve waste disposal, and make the waste reusable. In a hospital environment there is different color code that decides which equipment should be disposed of. The doctors and the nurse are the people who decide what color code is to be used for the disposal of medical equipment. The different color-coded waste bin is chosen for making reusable waste into a fertilizer for agricultural fields. To do this process the system is designed in an efficient method and cost reduction is maintained until the end of the process. Before entering the recycling process all the waste should be sanitized. After the verification process is done on the waste materials the recycling process gets started on the basis of the color code of the waste collection. A smart bin will be designed for each color code based on the usage of the medical equipment; the segregation process will be carried out in each phase.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for COVID-19, binds to its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and replicates within the cells of the nasal cavity, then spreads along the airway tracts, causing mild clinical manifestations, and, in a majority of patients, a persisting loss of smell. In some individuals, SARS-CoV-2 reaches and infects several organs, including the lung, leading to severe pulmonary disease. SARS-CoV-2 induces neurological symptoms, likely contributing to morbidity and mortality through unknown mechanisms. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid with pleiotropic properties and functions in many tissues, including the nervous system. S1P regulates neurogenesis and inflammation and it is implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS). Notably, Fingolimod (FTY720), a modulator of S1P receptors, has been approved for the treatment of MS and is being tested for COVID-19. Here, we discuss the putative role of S1P on viral infection and in the modulation of inflammation and survival in the stem cell niche of the olfactory epithelium. This could help to design therapeutic strategies based on S1P-mediated signaling to limit or overcome the host–virus interaction, virus propagation and the pathogenesis and complications involving the nervous system.",2020-09-15,"Meacci, Elisabetta; Garcia-Gil, Mercedes; Pierucci, Federica",Int J Mol Sci,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/b76afafaa4dacf48bd4552f2e53e8d6bf12f6ba2.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7556035.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32942748/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21186773,221789447.0

In 2004, a taskforce of the European Association for Palliative Care (EAPC) launched the 'Guide for development of palliative nurse education in Europe' (hereinafter, the EAPC 2004 Guide). No systematic evaluation of its impact in the development of palliative care education was undertaken. AIMS To describe current undergraduate and postgraduate nursing education across Europe; to identify the roles that nurses with different palliative care educational levels have in palliative care; and to assess the uptake of the EAPC 2004 Guide in the development of palliative care nursing in Europe. DESIGN Descriptive research involving an online survey among nursing experts, and the consultation of national representatives. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS A total of 135 nurses (52% response rate) from 25 countries completed the online survey; representatives from 16 countries were consulted. RESULTS In 14 (56%) countries, palliative care was not identified as a mandatory subject within undergraduate nursing education. The EAPC 2004 Guide is widely known and was/is being used in many countries to promote palliative care nursing education. Large variations were found across and within country responses. CONCLUSIONS Palliative care nursing education varies largely in Europe. The wide awareness and use of the EAPC 2004 Guide show how policy measures can influence the development of palliative care education.

cuvlm6sq,,WHO,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on final year medical students in the United Kingdom: a national survey,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) global pandemic has resulted in unprecedented public health measures. This has impacted the UK education sector with many universities halting campus-based teaching and examinations. The aim of this study is to identify the impact of COVID-19 on final year medical students' examinations and placements in the United Kingdom (UK) and how it might impact their confidence and preparedness going into their first year of foundation training. METHODS: A 10-item online survey was distributed to final year medical students across 33 UK medical schools. The survey was designed by combining dichotomous, multiple choice and likert response scale questions. Participants were asked about the effect that the COVID-19 global pandemic had on final year medical written exams, electives, assistantships and objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs). The survey also explored the student's confidence and preparedness going into their first year of training under these new unprecedented circumstances. RESULTS: Four hundred forty students from 32 UK medical schools responded. 38.4% (n = 169) of respondents had their final OSCEs cancelled while 43.0% (n = 189) had already completed their final OSCEs before restrictions. 43.0% (n = 189) of assistantship placements were postponed while 77.3% (n = 340) had electives cancelled. The impact of COVID-19 on OSCEs, written examinations and student assistantships significantly affected students' preparedness (respectively p = 0.025, 0.008, 0.0005). In contrast, when measuring confidence, only changes to student assistantships had a significant effect (p = 0.0005). The majority of students feel that measures taken during this pandemic to amend their curricula was necessary. Respondents also agree that assisting in hospitals during the outbreak would be a valuable learning opportunity. CONCLUSIONS: The impact on medical student education has been significant, particularly affecting the transition from student to doctor. This study showed the disruptions to student assistantships had the biggest effect on students' confidence and preparedness. For those willing to assist in hospitals to join the front-line workforce, it is crucial to maintain their wellbeing with safeguards such as proper inductions, support and supervision.",2020,"Choi, Byung; Jegatheeswaran, Lavandan; Minocha, Amal; Alhilani, Michel; Nakhoul, Maria; Mutengesa, Ernest",BMC Med Educ,,#617318,,,,,220266371.0

First case was registered in China, and then, it got spread in most of the countries of the world. Initially, the speed of spread was slow but later on, its spread rate was very really high and on analysis it turned out to be exponential. Governments all across the world imposed lockdowns, and people were asked to practice social distancing in order to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Later on, it was announced as pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO). Machine learning-driven methods can prove to be really vital in predicting risks, effects and parameters of this pandemic. These predictions will help in making strategies to control its spread and understand its nature. More research is beginning to anticipate and a remarkable amount of machine learning models are being talked about to predict COVID-19 cases used by experts or researchers around the globe. In this research project, we have used univariate LSTM model to make predictions. The number of confirmed cases, number of recovered cases and the number of death cases in the coming days are being predicted. Mean absolute error (MAE) is used as the measure of performance metric of the predicted results. The results produced are quite accurate.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA vaccines were constructed to express Ebola virus GP. Mice were injected with GP DNA vaccines and their splenocytes were used for hybridoma production. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), limiting dilution subcloning, antibody purification methods, and Western blot assays were used to select GP-specific hybridomas and purify monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) from the hybridoma cells. RESULTS: Twelve hybridomas, the cell supernatants of which displayed GP-binding activity, were selected by ELISA. When purified MAbs from 12 hybridomas were tested for their reactivity to GP, 11 MAbs, except for 1 MAb (from the A6-9 hybridoma) displaying an IgG2a type, were identified as IgM isotypes. Those 11 MAbs failed to recognize GP. However, the MAb from A6-9 recognized the mucin-like region of GP and remained reactive to the antigen at the lowest tested concentration (1.95 ng/mL). This result suggests that IgM-secreting hybridomas are predominantly generated by DNA vaccination. However, boosting with GP resulted in greater production of IgG-secreting hybridomas than GP DNA vaccination alone. CONCLUSION: DNA vaccination may preferentially generate IgM-secreting hybridomas, but boosting with the protein antigen can reverse this propensity. Thus, this protein boosting approach may have implications for the production of IgG-specific hybridomas in the context of the DNA vaccination platform. In addition, the purified monoclonal IgG antibodies may be useful as therapeutic antibodies for controlling Ebola virus infection.",2017-07-26,"Lee, Si-Hyeong; Han, Baek-Sang; Choe, Jongseon; Sin, Jeong-Im",Clin Exp Vaccine Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/839df627ece5b5fc7bb1ce3b4f96127677fd0494.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5540962.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.7774/cevr.2017.6.2.135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28775978/,29192492.0

Innate immunity is critical for cell-autonomous clearance of intracellular pathogens like Burkholderia by regulating programmed cell death. Inflammasome-dependent inflammatory cytokine release and cell death contribute to host protection against Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia thailandensis; however, the contribution of apoptosis and necroptosis to protection is not known. Here, we found that bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) lacking key components of pyroptosis died via apoptosis during infection. BMDMs lacking molecules required for pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis (PANoptosis), however, were significantly resistant to B. thailandensis-induced cell death until later stages of infection. Consequently, PANoptosis-deficient BMDMs failed to limit B. thailandensis-induced cell-cell fusion, which permits increased intercellular spread and replication compared to wild-type or pyroptosis-deficient BMDMs. Respiratory B. thailandensis infection resulted in higher mortality in PANoptosis-deficient mice than in pyroptosis-deficient mice, indicating that, in the absence of pyroptosis, apoptosis is essential for efficient control of infection in vivo.

The purpose of this study was to investigate 62 subjects in Wuhan, China, with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia and describe the CT features of this epidemic disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective study of 62 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia was performed. CT images and clinical data were reviewed. Two thoracic radiologists evaluated the distribution and CT signs of the lesions and also scored the extent of involvement of the CT signs. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare lesion distribution and CT scores. The chi-square test was used to compare the CT signs of early-phase versus advanced-phase COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS. A total of 62 patients (39 men and 23 women; mean [± SD] age, 52.8 ± 12.2 years; range, 30-77 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Twenty-four of 30 patients who underwent routine blood tests (80.0%) had a decreased lymphocyte count. Of 27 patients who had their erythrocyte sedimentation rate and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level assessed, 18 (66.7%) had an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and all 27 (100.0%) had an elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level. Multiple lesions were seen on the initial CT scan of 52 of 62 patients (83.9%). Forty-eight of 62 patients (77.4%) had predominantly peripheral distribution of lesions. The mean CT score for the upper zone (3.0 ± 3.4) was significantly lower than that for the middle (4.5 ± 3.8) and lower (4.5 ± 3.7) zones (p = 0.022 and p = 0.020, respectively), and there was no significant difference in the mean CT score of the middle and lower zones (p = 1.00). The mean CT score for the anterior area (4.4 ± 4.1) was significantly lower than that for the posterior area (7.7 ± 6.3) (p = 0.003). CT findings for the patients were as follows: 25 patients (40.3%) had ground-glass opacities (GGO), 21 (33.9%), consolidation; 39 (62.9%), GGO plus a reticular pattern; 34 (54.8%), vacuolar sign; 28 (45.2%), microvascular dilation sign; 35 (56.5%), fibrotic streaks; 21 (33.9%), a subpleural line; and 33 (53.2%), a subpleural transparent line. With regard to bronchial changes seen on CT, 45 patients (72.6%) had air bronchogram, and 11 (17.7%) had bronchus distortion. In terms of pleural changes, CT showed that 30 patients (48.4%) had pleural thickening, 35 (56.5%) had pleural retraction sign, and six (9.7%) had pleural effusion. Compared with early-phase disease (&#8804; 7 days after the onset of symptoms), advanced-phase disease (8-14 days after the onset of symptoms) was characterized by significantly increased frequencies of GGO plus a reticular pattern, vacuolar sign, fibrotic streaks, a subpleural line, a subpleural transparent line, air bronchogram, bronchus distortion, and pleural effusion; however, GGO significantly decreased in advanced-phase disease. CONCLUSION. CT examination of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia showed a mixed and diverse pattern with both lung parenchyma and the interstitium involved. Identification of GGO and a single lesion on the initial CT scan suggested early-phase disease. CT signs of aggravation and repair coexisted in advanced-phase disease. Lesions presented with a characteristic multifocal distribution in the middle and lower lung regions and in the posterior lung area. A decreased lymphocyte count and an increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level were the most common laboratory findings.",2020,"Zhou, Shuchang; Wang, Yujin; Zhu, Tingting; Xia, Liming",AJR Am J Roentgenol,,#5523,,,,,212568150.0

Doctors of chiropractic (DCs) are trained to manage these common conditions and can provide non-pharmacological treatment aligned with international clinical practice guidelines. Although DCs practice in over 90 countries, chiropractic care is rarely available within integrated healthcare delivery systems. A lack of DCs in private practice, particularly in low-income communities, may also limit access to chiropractic care. Improving collaboration between medical providers and community-based DCs, or embedding DCs in medical settings such as hospitals or community health centres, will improve access to evidence-based care for musculoskeletal conditions. METHODS AND ANALYSES This scoping review will map studies of DCs working with or within integrated healthcare delivery systems. We will use the recommended six-step approach for scoping reviews. We will search three electronic data bases including Medline, Embase and Web of Science. Two investigators will independently review all titles and abstracts to identify relevant records, screen the full-text articles of potentially admissible records, and systematically extract data from selected articles. We will include studies published in English from 1998 to 2020 describing medical settings that have established formal relationships with community-based DCs (eg, shared medical record) or where DCs practice in medical settings. Data extraction and reporting will be guided by the Proctor Conceptual Model for Implementation Research, which has three domains: clinical intervention, implementation strategies and outcome measurement. Stakeholders from diverse clinical fields will offer feedback on the implications of our findings via a web-based survey. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval will not be obtained for this review of published and publicly accessible data, but will be obtained for the web-based survey. Our results will be disseminated through conference presentations and a peer-reviewed publication. Our findings will inform implementation strategies that support the adoption of chiropractic care within integrated healthcare delivery systems.",2021-01-25,"Roseen, Eric J; Kasali, Bolanle Aishat; Corcoran, Kelsey; Masselli, Kelsey; Laird, Lance; Saper, Robert B; Alford, Daniel P; Cohen, Ezra; Lisi, Anthony; Atlas, Steven J; Bean, Jonathan F; Evans, Roni; Bussières, André",BMJ open,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043754; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33495261/,231711317.0

However, it does not prevent infection altogether in all exposed individuals. Furthermore, emerging variants of SARS‐CoV‐2 impose a threat concerning the competency of the vaccines in combating the infection. This study aims to determine the variability in adverse events and the extent of breakthrough infections in the Indian population. A retrospective study was conducted using a pre‐validated questionnaire encompassing social, demographic, general health, the status of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, vaccination, associated adverse events, and breakthrough infections in the Indian population. Informed consent and ethical approval were obtained as per Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines. Participants, who provided the complete information, were Indian citizens, above 18 years, and if vaccinated, administered with either Covishield or Covaxin, were considered for the study. Data have been compiled in Microsoft Excel and analyzed for statistical differences using STATA 11. The responses from 2051 individuals fulfilling the inclusion criteria were analyzed. Among 2051, 1119 respondents were vaccinated and 932 respondents were non‐vaccinated. Among 1119 vaccinated respondents, 7 were excluded because of missing data. Therefore, out of 1112 vaccinated, 413 experienced adverse events with a major fraction of younger individuals, age 18–40 years, getting affected (74.82%; 309/413). Furthermore, considerably more females than males encountered adverse consequences to vaccination (p < 0.05). Among vaccinated participants, breakthrough infections were observed in 7.91% (88/1112; 57.96% males and 42.04% females) with the older age group, 61 years and above (odds ratio, 3.25 [1.32–8.03]; p = 0.011), and males were found to be at higher risk.

This study attempted to quantify the effect of such changes on the risk of infection in different settings, i.e., the community and hospitals. The 2002–2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Hong Kong, where 27% of cases were healthcare workers, was used as an example. A stochastic compartmental SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) model was used: the population was split into healthcare workers, hospitalized people and general population. Super spreading events (SSEs) were taken into account in the model. The temporal evolutions of the daily effective contact rates in the community and hospitals were modeled with smooth functions. Data augmentation techniques and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods were applied to estimate SARS epidemiological parameters. In particular, estimates of daily reproduction numbers were provided for each subpopulation. The average duration of the SARS infectious period was estimated to be 9.3 days (±0.3 days). The model was able to disentangle the impact of the two SSEs from background transmission rates. The effective contact rates, which were estimated on a daily basis, decreased with time, reaching zero inside hospitals. This observation suggests that public health measures and possible changes in individual behaviors effectively reduced transmission, especially in hospitals. The temporal patterns of reproduction numbers were similar for healthcare workers and the general population, indicating that on average, an infectious healthcare worker did not infect more people than any other infectious person.

To be prepared for the challenges of modern medicine, future physicians need a visionary mindset. The aim of this study is to determine the need for teaching such content among medical students in the context of visionary elective curricula and to examine these with regard to the desired topics and organizational structure. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study with 236 medical students from all semesters of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich. The survey consists of 50 questions and includes single choice, multiple choice, matrix questions, open-ended questions and Likert scales. Responses were examined using descriptive statistics and compared parametrically in sub-aspects. Results: Three-quarters of respondents would like to see curricular content on interdisciplinary interfaces with other disciplines. A suitable framework for this is seen by 87% of the respondents in a visionary elective curriculum. Students would like to see a broad range of specific content such as global health, politics, business, and computer science. The majority of respondents would like to see 1 unit of instruction per week and would participate in an appropriate program. Such an offering would promote creative (53.6%), critical (63.7%), and interdisciplinary thinking (69.0%) and train to become better physicians (87%).

We aimed to inform how individual and institutional factors contributed for the preparedness to respond during the first months of a public health emergency. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: We surveyed healthcare workers from a Local Health Unit in Portugal, which comprises primary health care centers and hospital services, including public health units and intensive care units, in the second and third months of the COVID-19 epidemic in Portugal. The 460 answers, completed by 252 participants (about 10% of the healthcare workers), were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regressions. We estimated adjusted odds ratios for the readiness and willingness to respond. RESULTS: Readiness to respond was associated with the perception of adequate infrastructures (aOR = 4.04, P < 0.005), lack of access to personal protective equipment (aOR = 0.26, P < 0.05) and organization (aOR = 0.31, P < 0.05). The willingness to act was associated with the perception of not being able to make a difference (aOR = 0.05, P < 0.005), risk of work-related burnout (aOR = 21.21, P < 0.01) and experiencing colleagues or patients’ deaths due to COVID-19 (aOR = 0.24, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Adequate organization, infrastructures, and access to personal protective equipment may be crucial for workers' preparedness in a new public health emergency, as well workers’ understanding of their roles and expected impact.

Radial glial progenitors (RGPs) generate the majority of neurons in developing brains. Here, we evaluated the acute alterations in RGPs after maternal sevoflurane exposure. METHODS: Pregnant mice were exposed to 2.5% sevoflurane for 6 hours on gestational day 14.5. Interkinetic nuclear migration (INM) of RGPs in the ventricular zone (VZ) of the fetal brain was evaluated by thymidine analogues labelling. Cell fate of RGP progeny was determined by immunostaining using various neural markers. The Morris water maze (MWM) was used to assess the neurocognitive behaviours of the offspring. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed for the potential mechanism, and the potential mechanism validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), Western blot and rescue experiments. Furthermore, INM was examined in human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived 3D cerebral organoids. RESULTS: Maternal sevoflurane exposure induced temporary abnormities in INM, and disturbed the cell cycle progression of RGPs in both rodents and cerebral organoids without cell fate alternation. RNA-Seq analysis, qPCR and Western blot showed that the Notch signalling pathway was a potential downstream target. Reactivation of Notch by Jag1 and NICD overexpression rescued the defects in INM. Young adult offspring showed no obvious cognitive impairments in MWM. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal sevoflurane exposure during neurogenic period temporarily induced abnormal INM of RGPs by targeting the Notch signalling pathway without inducing long-term effects on RGP progeny cell fate or offspring cognitive behaviours. More importantly, the defects of INM in hESC-derived cerebral organoids provide a novel insight into the effects of general anaesthesia on human brain development.",2021,"Jiang, Ming; Tang, Tianxiang; Liang, Xinyue; Li, Juchen; Qiu, Yue; Liu, Shiwen; Bian, Shan; Xie, Yunli; Fang, Fang; Cang, Jing",Cell Prolif,,#33955094,,,,,233868621.0

Pain response was assessed using Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP), duration of first cry and salivary-cortisol concentrations. RESULT The PIPP scores were significantly higher in the nCPAP compared with HHHFNC group (10 (7-12) vs 4 (2-6), P<0.01). None of the infants in the HHHFNC group had severe pain defined as a PIPP score >12, compared with 5 (13.5%) infants in the nCPAP group.

Because it grows well in cell culture, FCV is often used as a model virus of non-culturable caliciviruses. In this study, a cell-free and two cell culture-based biosensor assay systems were established to detect FCV protease activity. The assays utilize luciferase sensor technology or second-generation bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET(2)). A luciferase sensor was designed to contain an FCV protease cleavage motif within the permutated luciferase (GloSensor). The BRET(2)-based probe contained the same cleavage motif flanked by a renilla luciferase and a variant of green fluorescent protein. To confirm the specificity of these assay systems, GloSensor or a BRET(2)-based probe containing a mutation in the cleavage motif was also constructed. In a cell-free assay, GloSensor showed increased luminescence in proportion to the amount of FCV protease, while no signal change was observed when the construct harboring the mutant cleavage motif was used. A feline cell line stably expressing GloSensor or the BRET(2)-based probe was established. Increased levels of GloSensor luminescence, and decreased levels of BRET(2) signals were observed according to input FCV titers. In contrast, no significant signal change was observed in the cells stably expressing the mutant cleavage motif. GloSensor and the BRET(2)-based probe were capable of detecting the inhibitory activity of ribavirin in FCV-infected cells. Our results demonstrate that these biosensors are useful to detect FCV protease activity induced in infected cells, and well worth consideration for screening of anti-FCV protease compounds in cell-free system as well as anti-FCV compounds in cultured cells.",2011-02-11,"Oka, Tomoichiro; Takagi, Hirotaka; Tohya, Yukinobu; Murakami, Kosuke; Takeda, Naokazu; Wakita, Takaji; Katayama, Kazuhiko",Antiviral Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/906cfeed2a704a21a656f435623c5e4450197ba3.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127765.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2011.02.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21316392/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354211000301; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354211000301,19539215.0

The first three quarter years of 2020 were characterized by an unprecedented reduction of elective inpatient services and a prioritization of intensive care capacity for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. This also resulted in clear consequences for the services provided in cardiac surgery. In addition, during the course of the year the personnel in hospitals were confronted with a plethora of amendments in the legal framework conditions. Nevertheless, the modified German diagnosis-related groups (G-DRG) system 2021 was calculated by the Institute for the Remuneration System in Hospitals (InEK). This article describes and assesses the most important amendments of the modified G­DRG system 2021 for cardiac, thoracic and vascular surgery. Methods: Analysis of the relevant diagnoses, procedures and G­DRG structures in the system versions for 2020 and 2021 based on the information published by the InEK and the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM). Results: Expansions of the relevant classification systems for diagnoses (ICD-10-GM 2021) and procedures (OPS 2021) lead to an increase in specific coding of essential interventions and operations in cardiovascular surgery. Within the framework of the adaptation of the G­DRG structures, the condensation of the previous fixed rates for heart transplantation to G­DRG A05Z and devaluation of coronary bypass operations and reconstructive vascular interventions are particularly important. Conclusion: For cardiovascular surgery there are manifold amendments with sometimes substantial repercussions for the case proceeds. Additionally, for many German hospitals the effects of the corona pandemic are not yet finally foreseeable. A further increasingly more urgent influencing factor particularly affecting vascular medicine is the increasing pressure to promote outpatient treatment. In this respect, the catalogue for outpatient operations in hospitals (AOP), which is expected in 2022 and will presumably be much expanded, will once again clearly increase the enforcement of outpatient performance of services that were previously performed as inpatient treatment.",2021,"Franz, Dominik; Wenke, Andreas; Roeder, Norbert",Z Herz Thorax Gefasschir,,#covidwho-1130765,,,,,232230902.0

There are a few reports of allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a potential treatment for ARDS. In this phase 1 clinical trial, we present the safety, feasibility, and tolerability of the multiple infusions of high dose MSCs, which originated from the placenta and umbilical cord, in critically ill COVID-19-induced ARDS patients. METHODS: A total of 11 patients diagnosed with COVID-19-induced ARDS who were admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) of two hospitals enrolled in this study. The patients were critically ill with severe hypoxemia and required mechanical ventilation. The patients received three intravenous infusions (200 × 10(6) cells) every other day for a total of 600 × 10(6) human umbilical cord MSCs (UC-MSCs; 6 cases) or placental MSCs (PL-MSCs; 5 cases). FINDINGS: There were eight men and three women who were 42 to 66 years of age. Of these, six (55%) patients had comorbidities of diabetes, hypertension, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and cardiomyopathy (CMP). There were no serious adverse events reported 24–48 h after the cell infusions. We observed reduced dyspnea and increased SpO2 within 48–96 h after the first infusion in seven patients. Of these seven patients, five were discharged from the ICU within 2–7 days (average: 4 days), one patient who had signs of acute renal and hepatic failure was discharged from the ICU on day 18, and the last patient suddenly developed cardiac arrest on day 7 of the cell infusion. Significant reductions in serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α; P < 0.01), IL-8 (P < 0.05), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (P < 0.01) were seen in all six survivors. IL-6 levels decreased in five (P = 0.06) patients and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) levels decreased in four (P = 0.14) patients. Four patients who had signs of multi-organ failure or sepsis died in 5–19 days (average: 10 days) after the first MSC infusion. A low percentage of lymphocytes (< 10%) and leukocytosis were associated with poor outcome (P = 0.02). All six survivors were well with no complaints of dyspnea on day 60 post-infusion. Radiological parameters of the lung computed tomography (CT) scans showed remarkable signs of recovery. INTERPRETATION: We suggest that multiple infusions of high dose allogeneic prenatal MSCs are safe and can rapidly improve respiratory distress and reduce inflammatory biomarkers in some critically ill COVID-19-induced ARDS cases. Patients that develop sepsis or multi-organ failure may not be good candidates for stem cell therapy. Large randomized multicenter clinical trials are needed to discern the exact therapeutic potentials of MSC in COVID-19-induced ARDS.

In this work, we present the detection method with computer vision using advanced CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and architecture used is VGGNet. Since the virus is a new variant of the coronavirus also named as SARS-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) by WHO (World Health Organization), requires a different technique for testing and detection. The detection procedure used to take too much time to confirm the infection. The techniques utilized to this point of time is limited and which creates an impossible type of situation to test a huge crowd of the population like India. So, it’s high time to come up with an alternative system for the Covid-19 Tests.

The putative mechanism involves formation of pathological anti-PF4 antibodies that activate platelets via the FcγRIIa receptor to drive thrombosis and the associated thrombocytopenia. Functional assays are important in the VITT diagnostic pathway as not all detectable PF4 antibodies are pathogenic. Detection of procoagulant platelets (platelets supporting thrombin generation) in presence of PF4 has been proposed as a diagnostic assay for VITT (Althaus et al). Procoagulant platelets are not typically generated in response to low level agonist stimulation;however, combination of ligand binding of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) (eg. PAR1) and ITAM linked receptors (eg. GPVI, CLEC2 and FcγRIIa) synergistically induce procoagulant platelet formation. Here, we describe an alternative flow cytometric assay to diagnose VITT. We hypothesized that priming of platelets with a PAR1 agonist at a level sufficient to release PF4, but insufficient to generate a significant procoagulant response in donor platelets, would provide a platform in which procoagulant response would be dependent on presence of FcγRIIa dependent procoagulant antibodies in patient plasma, without requirement for additional PF4. Methods: Our previously established flow cytometry-based procoagulant platelet assay (using cell death marker GSAO and P-selectin) was modified to incorporate exogenous patient plasma and performed on whole blood from healthy donors screened for FcγRIIa responsiveness (aggregation response to anti-CD9 antibody, ALB6), primed with 5 μM SFLLRN. The assay was performed on Australian patients referred for confirmatory VITT testing with probable VITT (confirmed thrombosis within 4-42 days of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination, D-Dimer > 5x ULN, platelets < 150 x 10 9/L or falling platelet count) after screening on PF4/heparin ELISA (Asserachrom HPIA IgG Assay, Stago Diagnostics). Procoagulant response was also measured in presence of 0.5 U/mL and 100 U/mL heparin, monoclonal FcγRIIa blocking antibody, IV.3, and intravenous immunoglobulin, IVIg. Some plasmas were incubated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Flow cytometry positive patients were also tested by serotonin release assay (SRA) and multiplate aggregometry. Clinical correlation was obtained. Results: Citrated plasma from 49 unique patients with suspected VITT are reported. Plasma from ELISA+ve patients with clinical picture consistent with VITT (n=31), significantly increased the procoagulant platelet proportions in healthy donors in presence of 5 μM SFLLRN (p<0.0001, Figure 1A). This increase was not seen with plasma from healthy donors (n=14);or individuals exposed to ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine without VITT: thrombocytopenic thrombosis patients who were ELISA-ve and SRA-ve (n=14);or low-level ELISA+ve patients without thrombocytopenia who were negative by either multiplate or SRA (n=4). The procoagulant platelet response induced by VITT positive plasma was reduced with low dose heparin (0.5 U/mL, p<0.01) except for 3 patients who showed a heparin-enhancing effect (Figure 1B). High dose heparin (100 U/mL, p<0.0001), IV.3 (10 µg/mL, p<0.0001) or IVIg (10 mg/mL, p<0.0001) abolished the procoagulant response (Figures 1C-D). The in vitro effect of IVIg was predictive of the in vivo response to IVIg therapy (Figure 1E). Addition of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein had no effect on the procoagulant platelet response. ChAdOx1 nCov-19 had an inconsistent effect on procoagulant platelet formation in presence of VITT plasma. Use of donors without a robust aggregation response to ALB6 resulted in false negative results. Conclusion: Induction of FcγRIIa dependent procoagulant response by patient plasma, suppressible by high dose heparin and IVIg, is highly indicative of VITT in the correct clinical circumstance. This assay modification of priming donor platelets from known FcγRIIa responsive donors ith a GPCR agonist to potentiate the ITAM signaling from platelet activating immune complexes, results in a sensitive and specific assay. This may represent a functional platform that can be adopted into diagnostic laboratories to identify patients with platelet-activating antibodies and potentially predict treatment responses.

The phenomenon of viral replication during intensive care is well known, even in patients without a history of immunosuppression, but it usually does not have a clinical impact. Systemic reactivation leads to viral DNA in blood. It remains unclear whether this replication is a marker of morbimortality or a true pathogenic process. Therefore, it is unclear what medical treatment is most appropriate for simple replication. In organ damage suspected to be induced by herpes virus, there is no consensus on the most appropriate treatment duration. Here, we report a rarely described case of multiorgan failure implicating herpes simplex virus and discuss its treatment. CASE REPORT: A 53-year-old Caucasian immunosuppressed woman was admitted to the intensive care unit for septic shock. She presented pneumonia due to Klebsiella pneumoniae. Two weeks after admission, she showed multiorgan failure with acute respiratory distress syndrome and circulation failure. She had digestive and cutaneous lesions typical of herpes simplex virus 1. Blood and respiratory polymerase chain reaction was strongly herpes simplex virus-1 positive. No other bacteria, fungi, or viruses were found. The evolution was rapidly favorable after the initiation of antiviral treatment. Treatment was stopped after 3 weeks of well-conducted antiviral therapy. Curative-dose treatment was interrupted despite continuous strongly positive blood polymerase chain reaction results. In this context, prophylactic treatment was continued. CONCLUSION: We report an exceptional presentation of multiorgan failure in the intensive care unit due to herpes simplex virus-1. The diagnosis was made based on typical herpes simplex virus-1 visceral lesions and the absence of other responsible microorganisms. Intense viral replication is a key diagnostic element.

However, there is sparse literature on the mechanism of lung-mediated brain injury and prevalence of ARDS-associated secondary ABI. We aimed to review and elucidate potential mechanisms of ARDS-mediated ABI from preclinical models and assess the prevalence of ABI and neurological outcome in ARDS with clinical studies. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed and five other databases reporting ABI and ARDS through July 6, 2020 and included studies with ABI and neurological outcome occurring after ARDS. We found 38 studies (10 preclinical studies with 143 animals; 28 clinical studies with 1175 patients) encompassing 9 animal studies (n = 143), 1 in vitro study, 12 studies on neurocognitive outcomes (n = 797), 2 clinical observational studies (n = 126), 1 neuroimaging study (n = 15), and 13 clinical case series/reports (n = 15). Six ARDS animal studies demonstrated evidence of neuroinflammation and neuronal damage within the hippocampus. Five animal studies demonstrated altered cerebral blood flow and increased intracranial pressure with the use of lung-protective mechanical ventilation. High frequency of ARDS-associated secondary ABI or poor neurological outcome was observed ranging 82–86% in clinical observational studies. Of the clinically reported ABIs (median age 49 years, 46% men), the most common injury was hemorrhagic stroke (25%), followed by hypoxic ischemic brain injury (22%), diffuse cerebral edema (11%), and ischemic stroke (8%). Cognitive impairment in patients with ARDS (n = 797) was observed in 87% (range 73–100%) at discharge, 36% (range 32–37%) at 6 months, and 30% (range 25–45%) at 1 year. Mechanisms of ARDS-associated secondary ABI include primary hypoxic ischemic injury from hypoxic respiratory failure, secondary injury, such as lung injury induced neuroinflammation, and increased intracranial pressure from ARDS lung-protective mechanical ventilation strategy. In summary, paucity of clinical data exists on the prevalence of ABI in patients with ARDS. Hemorrhagic stroke and hypoxic ischemic brain injury were commonly observed. Persistent cognitive impairment was highly prevalent in patients with ARDS.

Methods: Seventy-five pediatric patients with COVID-19 were classified according to clinical severity and evaluated in the allergy/immunology and pulmonology departments 1 to 3 months after the infection resolved. Blood was collected from the patients for a complete blood cell count and assessment of immunoglobulin and total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels, and skin-prick tests and spirometry tests were performed. Results: A total of 75 patients ages 5-18 years were evaluated. COVID-19 was asymptomatic/mild in 44 patients and moderate/severe/critical in 31 patients. Based on allergy evaluation, allergic rhinitis was diagnosed in 19 patients (25.3%), asthma in 10 patients (13%), and atopic dermatitis in 3 patients (4%). Aeroallergen sensitivity was detected in 26 patients (34.7%). COVID-19 infection was asymptomatic/mild in 15 patients with allergic rhinitis (78.9%) and in 21 with aeroallergen sensitivity (80.8%) (p = 0.038 and p = 0.005, respectively). There was no difference in severity between the patients with and without asthma (p = 0.550). The median (interquartile range) total IgE level was significantly higher in the asymptomatic/mild group (71.8 [30.7-211.2]) (p = 0.015). There were no differences in terms of spirometry parameters. Conclusion: Aeroallergen sensitization and allergic rhinitis in children may be associated with a milder course of COVID-19.

It has been associated with short-term absenteeism in school and has a negative impact on academic and daily activities. Therefore, the aim of the study was to show the evidence on the magnitude and correlates of dysmenorrhea in Ethiopia. METHOD: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched the literature from different databases such as PubMed/Medline, Science Direct, PsycINFO, and Cochrane library. We also used unpublished literature from Google, Google Scholar. The quality of the included articles was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data were extracted using a Microsoft Excel data extraction format. STATA version 14 statistical software was used for data analysis. To assess the heterogeneity of the primary articles, the Cochrane Q test statistics and the I2 test were carried out. Publication bias was inspected by funnel plot, and Egger's test was performed to confirm the presence of publication bias. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of dysmenorrhea and its associated factors. RESULT: A total of 12 studies were included in the final meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence estimate of dysmenorrhea among female students in Ethiopia is 71.69% (66.82%-76.56%). In our systematic review, among factors associated with dysmenorrhea, the family history of dysmenorrhea was frequently reported in included studies. Therefore, dysmenorrhea was significantly associated with a family history of dysmenorrhea (adjusted odds ratio = 4.69 (95% confidence interval: 2.80-7.85)). CONCLUSION: The pooled prevalence estimate of dysmenorrhea among students was much higher in Ethiopia.

Here, we identified 172 Cd-responsive lncRNAs and 295 differentially expressed target genes in the leaves of Populus tomentosa under Cd treatment. Functional annotation revealed that these lncRNAs involved in various processes, including photosynthesis, hormone regulation, and phenylalanine metabolism. Association studies identified 78 significant associations, representing 14 Cd-responsive lncRNAs and 28 target genes for photosynthetic and leaf physiological traits. Epistasis uncovered 83 pairwise interactions among these traits, unveiling Cd-responsive lncRNA-mediated genetic networks for photosynthesis and leaf physiology in P. tomentosa. We then focused on the roles of two Cd-responsive lncRNA-gene pairs, MSTRG.22608.1-PtoMYB73 and MSTRG.5634.1-PtoMYB27, in Cd tolerance of Populus, and detected insertions/deletions within lncRNAs as polymorphisms driving target gene expression. LncRNAs genotype analysis and heterologous overexpressing PtoMYB73 and PtoMYB27 in Arabidopsis indicated their positive effects on enhancing Cd tolerance, photosynthetic rate, and leaf growth, and the potential interaction mechanisms of PtoMYB73 with abiotic stresses.

However, these HCV-specific Igs are largely ineffective in vivo. The mechanism for the poor effectiveness is currently unknown. We hypothesize that the presence of nonneutralizing antibodies in HCV-specific Igs interferes with the function of neutralizing antibodies, resulting in the reduction or blockage of their effect. In the present study, we identified at least two epitopes at amino acid residues 412–419 (epitope I) and 434–446 (epitope II), located downstream of the hypervariable region I within the HCV E2 protein. We demonstrated that epitope I, but not epitope II, was implicated in HCV neutralization and that binding of a nonneutralizing antibody to epitope II completely disrupted virus neutralization mediated by antibody binding at epitope I. The dynamic interaction between nonneutralizing and neutralizing antibodies may thus play a key role in determining the outcomes of HCV infection. Further exploration of this interplay should lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of neutralization and immune escape and may indicate pathways for the manufacture of an effective HCV-specific Ig product for immune prophylaxis of HCV infection.",2007-05-15,"Zhang, Pei; Wu, Charles G.; Mihalik, Kathleen; Virata, Maria Luisa; Yu, Mei-ying W.; Alter, Harvey J.; Feinstone, Stephen M.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/39f90da160d768904bb0031a27e56272bf84a743.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC1866310.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17494735/,6052362.0

The study presented here characterizes the BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2 and Flu A+B (“Veritor SARS-CoV-2/Flu”) triplex assay. The performance for SARS-CoV-2 detection was determined using 298 specimens from patients reporting COVID-19 symptoms within 7 days from symptom onset (DSO) in comparison with the Lyra SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase PCR) assay (“Lyra SARS-CoV-2”) as the reference. The performance for flu A and flu B detection was determined using 75 influenza-positive and 40 influenza-negative retrospective specimens in comparison with the previously FDA-cleared BD Veritor System for Rapid Detection of Flu A+B assay (“Veritor Flu”) as the reference. The Veritor SARS-CoV-2/Flu assay met the FDA EUA acceptance criteria (86.7%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 75.8 to 93.1) for SARS-CoV-2 testing compared to Lyra SARS-CoV-2. The Veritor SARS-CoV-2/Flu assay also demonstrated 100% agreement with the Veritor Flu for Flu A+B assay. For flu A detection, the lower bound of the 95% CI was 91.2%; for flu B detection, the lower bound was 90.0%. The dual detection capability of Veritor SARS-CoV-2/Flu for the etiologic agents causing COVID-19 and flu will allow efficient differentiation between the two illnesses, inform disease management, and facilitate optimal treatment.

For the first time, the results of our study suggested that vaccination with BCG may increase the risk for COVID-19 at certain age, particularly in individuals vaccinated at childhood. Childhood BCG vaccination increased the likelihood of being diagnosed with COVID-19 fivefold in COVID-19 low-incidence countries and threefold in high-incidence countries. A reasonable explanation for this effect is the activation of certain innate immunity mechanisms associated with inflammatory reactions.

Proper PPE and airway management techniques are critical to prevent the transmission of respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19. APPROACH: In March 2020, the authors implemented a structured train-the-trainers curriculum to teach PPE techniques and a modified airway management algorithm for suspected COVID-19 patients. A single emergency medicine physician trainer taught 17 subsequent emergency medicine and critical care physician trainers the proper PPE and airway management techniques. The initial trainer and 7 of the subsequent trainers then instructed 99 other emergency medicine resident and attending physicians using in situ simulation. Trainers and learners completed retrospective pre–post surveys to assess their comfort teaching the material and performing the techniques, respectively. OUTCOMES: The surveys demonstrated a significant increase in the trainers’ comfort in teaching simulation-based education, from 4.00 to 4.53 on a 5-point Likert scale (P < .005), and in teaching the airway management techniques through simulation, from 2.47 to 4.47 (P < .001). There was no difference in the change in comfort level between those learners who were taught by the initial trainer and those who were taught by the subsequent trainers. These results suggest that the subsequent trainers were as effective in teaching the simulation material as the initial trainer. NEXT STEPS: Work is ongoing to investigate clinician- and patient-specific outcomes, including PPE adherence, appropriate AGP performance, complication rate, and learners’ skill retention.

India has witnessed two waves affecting around 31 million people representing 16% of the cases globally. To date, the epidemic waves have not been comprehensively investigated to understand pandemic progress in India. OBJECTIVE: Here, we aim for pan Indian cross-sectional evolutionary analysis since inception of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: High quality genomes, along with their collection date till 26th July 2021, were downloaded. Whole genome-based phylogeny was obtained. Further, the mutational analysis was performed using SARS-CoV-2 first reported from Wuhan (NC_045512.2) as reference. RESULTS: Based on reported cases and mutation rates, we could divide the Indian epidemic into seven phases. The average mutation rate for the pre-first wave was <11, which elevated to 17 in the first wave and doubled in the second wave (∼34). In accordance with mutation rate, VOCs and VOIs started appearing in the first wave (1.5%), which dominated the second (∼96%) and post-second wave (100%).

Dying and death are topics reluctantly discussed in open society. Yet, the global COVID-19 pandemic has drawn attention to the process of dying and death, and hence the survival of humankind. By embracing their finitude, humans attempt to create meaningful experiences in life and, therefore, attain “freedom towards death” (Heidegger, 1962: 311). This paper investigates how South African artist Diane Victor uses universally known myths and symbols of Christian iconography within a South African context to create meaning, as well as how she uses medium and exhibition sites to evoke intense emotions within viewers urging them to consider their finitude. By recognising how fragile and vulnerable life is, the artist captures the ephemeral in a poignant way. In this paper, I argue that Victor embraces the challenge of consecrating the forgotten or lost. Through incorporating religious icons, signs, and symbols in her work, Victor ‘catches ghosts’ of the ‘seen’ and ‘unseen’ in, about, of and from South Africa. Her works are understood through a contemporary reading of religious (Christian) iconography and interpreted in the symbolic and fragile mediums of smoke, stain, ash, charcoal, light and shadow, emphasising the ephemerality and impermanence of the human condition. © 2021.

We find that for small wavenumbers $k$, the kinetic energy spectrum shows Kolmogorov--like behavior which crosses over at a larger $k$ to a novel, elastic scaling regime, $E(q) \sim k^{-\xi}$, with $\xi \approx 2.3$, providing support to and extending the analysis of recent experimental results [Yi-Bao Zhang et. al., Science Advances 7, eabd3525 (2021)]. We uncover the mechanism of elastic scaling by studying the contribution of the polymers to the flux of kinetic energy through scales.The contribution can be decomposed into two parts: one, expected, increase in effective viscous dissipation of the flow and two, a purely elastic contribution that dominates over the nonlinear flux in the range of $k$ over which the elastic scaling is observed. The multiscale balance between the two fluxes determines the crossover wavenumber which, intriguingly, depends non-monotically on the Deborah number. The probability distribution function of polymer extension also depends non-monotonically on the Deborah number. Consistent with this picture, real space structure functions also show two scaling ranges, with intermittency present in both of them in equal measure.",2021-11-22,"Rosti, Marco E; Perlekar, Prasad; Mitra, Dhrubaditya",,,,2111.11224,document_parses/pdf_json/c46a698f21c362b054ad9b3d5bd3184097524b0f.json,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.11224v1.pdf,244478336.0

TLR4 is an innate immune receptor on the cell surface that recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) including viral proteins and triggers the production of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines to combat infection. It is expressed on both immune cells and tissue-resident cells. ACE2, the reported entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is only present on ~1-2% of the cells in the lungs or has a low pulmonary expression, and recently, the spike protein has been proposed to have the strongest protein-protein interaction with TLR4. Here, we review and connect evidence for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 having direct and indirect binding to TLR4, together with other viral precedents, which when combined shed light on the COVID-19 pathophysiological puzzle. We propose a model in which the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein binds TLR4 and activates TLR4 signalling to increase cell surface expression of ACE2 facilitating entry. SARS-CoV-2 also destroys the type II alveolar cells that secrete pulmonary surfactants, which normally decrease the air/tissue surface tension and block TLR4 in the lungs thus promoting ARDS and inflammation. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2-induced myocarditis and multiple-organ injury may be due to TLR4 activation, aberrant TLR4 signalling, and hyperinflammation in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, TLR4 contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, and its overactivation causes a prolonged or excessive innate immune response. TLR4 appears to be a promising therapeutic target in COVID-19, and since TLR4 antagonists have been previously trialled in sepsis and in other antiviral contexts, we propose the clinical trial testing of TLR4 antagonists in the treatment of severe COVID-19. Also, ongoing clinical trials of pulmonary surfactants in COVID-19 hold promise since they also block TLR4.",2021-01-14,"Aboudounya, Mohamed M.; Heads, Richard J.",Mediators Inflamm,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/d28514ba06540a05125a403eee43709bfc7706a5.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7811571.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33505220/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/8874339,231721059.0

Invulnerability is the fundamental choice to prevent the ruining event of COVID-19, as the drugs and antibodies are in the phase of preliminary clinical trials. Within this brief period, a few strains of SARS-CoV-2 have been recognized by the vaccine manufacturers, which could be an incorrect guess about the strain that will end up spreading. Since the circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains continue to mutate, immunizations, if at all works, might be for a restricted time. We have not put sufficient time in research to understand the immune responses that correlate with protection as this could help refine vaccines. Here, we have summed up the adequacy of the immunomodulatory component of probiotics for the prevention against viral infections. Furthermore, an in silico data have been provided in support of the “probiotics-derived lipopeptides” role in inactivating spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and its host receptor molecule, ACE2. Among well characterized lipopeptides derived from different probiotic strains, subtilisin (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens), curvacin A (Lactobacillus curvatus), sakacin P (Lactobacillus sakei), lactococcin Gb (Lactococcus lactis) was utilized in this study to demonstrate a higher binding proclivity to S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 and human ACE2. The outcome revealed noteworthy capabilities of the lipopeptides, due to their amphiphilic nature, to bind spike protein and receptor molecule, which may act to competitively inhibit the mandatory interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the host epithelial cell expressing ACE2 for its entry into the cell for reproduction. In the current situation, probiotic treatment alongside chemotherapy may assist in bringing about substantial improvement of the health of COVID-19 patients. At the same time, probiotics may aid towards building up the immune defenses in people to evade COVID-19.

METHOD: This was a cross-sectional survey among COVID-19 inpatients in two isolation wards of a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from March 7, 2020, to March 24, 2020. Participants' demographic data, clinical data and levels of circulating inflammatory markers were collated. Mental health symptoms were evaluated with questionnaires, which included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scale, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and questions about patients' self-perceived illness severity. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to explore factors that associated with mental symptoms, and a structural equation model (SEM) was used to assess the possible relationships between those factors and the patients' mental health. RESULTS: Among the 85 participants, 45.9% had symptoms of depression (PHQ-9 &#8805; 5), 38.8% had anxiety (GAD-7 &#8805; 5), and 54.1% had insomnia (ISI &#8805; 8). According to multivariate regression analysis, female sex, a higher level of interleukin (IL)-1ß and greater self-perceived illness severity were all significantly associated with a higher PHQ-9 score, higher GAD-7 score and higher ISI score. In addition, the disease duration and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were positively related to patients' self-perceived illness severity. The results of the SEM analyses suggested that sex (ß = 0.313, P < 0.001), self-perceived illness severity (ß = 0.411, P < 0.001) and levels of inflammatory markers (ß = 0.358, P = 0.002) had direct effects on patients' mental health. The disease duration (ß = 0.163, P = 0.003) and levels of inflammatory markers (ß = 0.101, P = 0.016) also indirectly affected patients' mental health, with self-perceived illness severity acting as a mediator. CONCLUSION: A majority of COVID-19 infected inpatients reported experiencing mental health disturbances. Female sex, disease duration, levels of inflammatory markers and self-perceived illness severity are factors that could be used to predict the severity of patients' mental symptoms.",2020,"Hu, Yanyu; Chen, Yingying; Zheng, Yixiong; You, Ciping; Tan, Jing; Hu, Lan; Zhang, Zhenqing; Ding, Lijun",Brain Behav Immun,,#652159,,,,,220526778.0

Often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that different epidemics can exhibit, even when they have the same R(0). Here, we reformulate and extend a classic result from random network theory to forecast the size of an epidemic using estimates of the distribution of secondary infections, leveraging both its average R(0) and the underlying heterogeneity. Importantly, epidemics with lower R(0) can be larger if they spread more homogeneously (and are therefore more robust to stochastic fluctuations). We illustrate the potential of this approach using different real epidemics with known estimates for R(0), heterogeneity and epidemic size in the absence of significant intervention. Further, we discuss the different ways in which this framework can be implemented in the data-scarce reality of emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19 the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically. Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond R(0).",2020-11-04,"Hébert-Dufresne, Laurent; Althouse, Benjamin M.; Scarpino, Samuel V.; Allard, Antoine",J R Soc Interface,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/1a963cf8dda5f154ac1d2e03ef7b9b3dd983e7b1.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7729039.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2020.0393; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33143594/,226238420.0

Patients with major events were older, with lower baseline SatO2, and higher number of Wells' criteria and Charlson comorbidity index. Among these patients, those with hypertension were at higher risk for early occurrence of events (≤ first three days of hospitalization). CONCLUSION Major adverse events may occur early in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with a high-risk profile.

We examined patterns in unemployment following this peak in counties with rapid increases in COVID-19 incidence. METHOD: We used CDC aggregate county data to identify counties with rapid increases in COVID-19 incidence (rapid riser counties) during July 1–October 31, 2020. We used a linear regression model with fixed effect to calculate the change of unemployment rate difference in these counties, stratified by the county’s social vulnerability (an indicator compiled by CDC) in the two months before the rapid riser index month compared to the index month plus one month after the index month. RESULTS: Among the 585 (19% of U.S. counties) rapid riser counties identified, the unemployment rate gap between the most and least socially vulnerable counties widened by 0.40 percentage point (p<0.01) after experiencing a rapid rise in COVID-19 incidence. Driving the gap were counties with lower socioeconomic status, with a higher percentage of people in racial and ethnic minority groups, and with limited English proficiency. CONCLUSION: The widened unemployment gap after COVID-19 incidence rapid rise between the most and least socially vulnerable counties suggests that it may take longer for socially and economically disadvantaged communities to recover. Loss of income and benefits due to unemployment could hinder behaviors that prevent spread of COVID-19 (e.g., seeking healthcare) and could impede response efforts including testing and vaccination.

Global stakeholders have raised concerns that the pandemic is putting enormous strain on parents and other caregivers, compromising capabilities and enabling environments for nurturing care of young children and therefore likely impacting children's development. This rapid review takes stock of emerging research on nurturing care for young children during the COVID-19 crisis. Two databases were searched in addition to an extensive search for grey literature, drawing on 112 scholarly and scientific studies from more than 30 countries that have examined components of nurturing care during the pandemic, namely: responsive caregiving, early learning and play, and children's safety and security. There are some reports of unexpected positive benefits of the pandemic on families, including increased father involvement in caregiving. But more commonly, the studies' findings reveal numerous issues of concern, including parental and caregiver mental health difficulties and less responsive parent and child relationships, increased screen time among children, limited opportunities for outdoor play, and fractured systems for responding to potential child neglect and maltreatment. Evidence suggests limited access and challenges in the provision of remote learning for the youngest learners, such as those in early childhood education. The findings can inform global stakeholders, who have advocated for increased support and funding to ensure young children and other caregivers are supported and protected during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The primary aim of this study was to critically appraise available systematic reviews describing interventions for PPD. The secondary aim was to evaluate the methodological quality of the included systematic reviews and their conclusions. METHODS An electronic database search of MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from 2000 to 2020 was conducted to identify systematic reviews that examined an intervention for PPD. A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews was utilized to independently score each included systematic review which was then critically appraised to better define the most effective therapeutic options for PPD. RESULTS Of the 842 studies identified, 83 met the a priori criteria for inclusion. Based on the systematic reviews with the highest methodological quality, we found that use of antidepressants and telemedicine were the most effective treatments for PPD. Symptoms of PPD were also improved by traditional herbal medicine and aromatherapy. Current evidence for physical exercise and cognitive behavioural therapy in treating PPD remains equivocal. A significant, but weak relationship between AMSTAR score and journal impact factor was observed (p = 0.03, r = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.43) whilst no relationship was found between the number of total citations (p = 0.27, r = 0.12; 95% CI, - 0.09 to 0.34), or source of funding (p = 0.19).

This can make grief management extremely challenging for families. The Clinical Psychology unit of an Italian hospital offered a bereavement follow-up call to such families. This study aimed to explore the families' experiences and needs collected during these calls, and the role that the psychologists played through the call. A total of 246 families were called over 3 months. Multiple qualitative methods included: (i) written reports of the calls with relatives of patients who died at the hospital for COVID-19; (ii) qualitative semi-structured interviews with psychologists involved in the calls; (iii) observation of psychologists' peer group discussions. A thematic analysis was conducted. Six themes emerged: without death rituals, solitary, unexpected, unfair, unsafe, coexisting with other stressors. Families' reactions were perceived by psychologists as close to a traumatic grief. Families' needs ranged from finding alternative rituals to giving meaning and expressing different emotions. The psychologists played both a social-institutional and a psychological-human role through the calls (e.g., they cured disrupted communication or validated feelings and choices). This study highlighted the potential of traumatic grief of families of COVID-19 victims, and provided indications for supporting them within the space of a short phone call.",2021,"Menichetti Delor, Julia Paola; Borghi, Lidia; Cao di San Marco, Eugenia; Fossati, Ivan; Vegni, Elena",,,#1052858,,,,,231754272.0

v7mvalrs,,WHO,The New Consumer Behaviour Paradigm amid COVID-19: Permanent or Transient?,,,,unk,"A critical situation pushes human behaviour towards different directions with some aspects of behaviour being irrevocable. COVID-19 pandemic is not a normal crisis, and to control the spread of disease various measures were taken including complete and then partial lockdown. Since all elements of the economy are intricately interrelated with public health measures and lockdown, this resulted in economic instabilities of the nations hinting towards change in market dynamics. In every market, consumers are the drivers of the market competitiveness, growth and economic integration. With economic instability, consumers are also experiencing a transformation in behaviour, though how much of transformation experienced during the crisis will sustain is a question. This article looks at the consumer behaviour during COVID-19 crisis and in the subsequent lockdown period when the world stood still for more than a quarter of a year. Further, the article attempts to weave through the maze of literature available about consumer behaviour in normal times and in crisis times, strengthens it with the rapid assessment reports culled out by the different consulting organisations during lockdown phase, substantiates the same with first-hand telling and retelling of experiences by consumers and professionals with marketing background to bring up a hypothesis of the pandemic affecting a paradigm shift from consumer materialism to consumer spiritualism. The proposition offers further testable hypotheses for future research to understand consumer sentiments or requirement in buying ‘what is enough’ within the marketing context and how it can be reinforced post-COVID crisis for ensuring sustainability of business models. It would also be interesting to explore the correlates of this forced consumer behaviour with other variables such as learning from crisis, changing needs, personality, nationality, culture, new market segment and age to develop new models of consumer behaviour.",2020,"Mehta, Seema; Saxena, Tanjul; Purohit, Neetu",J.

Massive changes in the health care system imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic clearly impact the overall quality of medical care. In this survey, we aim to explore experiences and concerns of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) regarding the current pandemic. METHODS: A 40-item web-based questionnaire on disease-related experiences and concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic was made available to patients with IBD from 28 April 2020 to 31 July 2020. RESULTS: An increased risk of SARS-CoV2 infection was a concern for 56.7% of the 1199 patients (aged 41.3±12.8, women 77%, Crohn's disease 58.8%, ulcerative colitis 38.5%); 61.7% feared an increased risk of severe disease course of COVID-19. Effective preventive measures in either outpatient practices or hospitals were observed by 84.7% of the patients. Appointments with an IBD specialist were canceled in 38.7%, frequently on the patients' initiative. Telecommunication visits were considered an acceptable alternative to personal visits by 71.0%. Medication was reduced or paused in 6.9% because of the pandemic. A swab (SARS-CoV2-PCR) was done in 13.2% of the patients; only 3 patients (0.25%) were tested positive. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic is a major concern of patients with IBD. However, the cumulative prevalence in our cohort is low. Patients at risk should be identified and counseled individually.

H460 and A549 cells were then selected for the determination of CCAT1 expression after exposure to radiation (0, 2, 4, 6 Gy) at different time points (0, 6, 12, 24 h). Colony forming assay was performed to evaluate the effects of CCAT1 siRNA or pcDNA3.1-CCAT1 vector on the radiosensitivity of H460 and A549 cells. Then, flow cytometry, western blotting and qRT-PCR were also conducted. CCAT1 was increased in NSCLC cells when compared with 16HBE cells, which was declined in a time- and dosage-dependent manner after exposure to radiation. The H460 and A549 cell colonies were decreased and the Î³-H2AX expression was elevated with the increase of radiation dosage, which was more obvious in those transfected with CCAT1 siRNA. CCAT1 downregulation arrested NSCLC cells at G2/M phase. Moreover, the enhanced apoptosis of radiotherapy-treated NSCLC cells with reductions of p-p38/p38, p-ERK/ERK, and p-JNK/JNK was promoted by siCCAT1, but it was reversed by pcDNA3.1-CCAT1 vector.

Approximately US$ 4.2 billion (INR 310 billion) from a vast pile of unspent social special-purpose funds. How and why did such a large volume of funds accumulate in the first place, and why did it take a public health emergency to release them? What might be the consequences of their use under these conditions - especially for our understanding of governance and accountability in social welfare provision? This paper presents a brief analysis of two preliminary case studies of specific social special-purpose funds in India. We rely on a handful of unstructured interviews and informal discussions with subnational government officials, civil society actors, trade union representatives, and local community leaders in January 2020, and that were pursued virtually following the lockdown. This is bolstered by analysis of primary documents, including Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) reports, relevant laws, and press reports. We argue that non-disbursement should be understood as a institutional matter, and not only as technical or implementation failure. Moreover, as such funds are likely to mushroom following Covid-19, our findings suggest that policymakers should focus on the institutional design, decision-making and accountability structures for the flow and distribution of Covid funds, rather than merely emphasising their collection.",2020-08-12,"Desai, Deval; Randeria, Shalini",World Dev,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/84d7f30483b659ae1daf754d6a7d6c669ca0aa0a.json,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105138; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0305750X20302655; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X20302655?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836693/,221097692.0

We found the propagation of droplets and aerosols highly affected by this condition. The spread of respiratory droplets by the action of sneezing is characterized by the dynamics of two groups of droplets of different sizes: Larger droplets (300-900 µm) have a ballistic trajectory and can be spread up to 5 m, while a cloud of smaller droplets (100-200 µm) can be transported and dispersed at longer distances up to 18 m by the action of the turbulent airflow. In relation to the spread of exhaled aerosols during respiration, these remain in the air for long periods of time. In the presence of intense or moderate airflow, this set of particles follow airflow streamlines, and thus their propagation is directly determined by the air velocity field. Given the scientific evidence, these results should be considered in public debate about the aerodynamic dispersion characteristics of scenarios where social interactions occur and about the measures to mitigate the spread of the virus. © 2021 by the authors.

The reliability of the information extracted from the genotyping efforts depends on a number of aspects, including the quality of the input material, applied technology and potential laboratory-specific biases. These variables must be monitored to ensure genotype reliability. The current lack of guidelines for SARS-CoV-2 genotyping leads to inclusion of error-containing genome sequences in studies of viral spread and evolution. Results We used clinical samples and synthetic viral genomes to evaluate the impact of experimental factors, including viral load and sequencing depth, on correct sequence determination using an amplicon-based approach. We found that at least 1000 viral genomes are necessary to confidently detect variants in the genome at frequencies of 10% or higher. The broad applicability of our recommendations was validated in >200 clinical samples from six independent laboratories. The genotypes of clinical isolates with viral load above the recommended threshold cluster by sampling location and period. Our analysis also supports the rise in frequency of 20A.EU1 and 20A.EU2, two recently reported European strains whose dissemination was favoured by travelling during the summer 2020.

Because of their structural plasticity, they can interact with multiple partners. The protein interactions between IDPs and their partners form scale-free protein interaction networks (PINs) that facilitate information flow in the cell. Because of their plasticity, IDPs typically occupy hub positions in cellular PINs. Furthermore, their conformational dynamics and propensity for post-translational modifications contribute to ""conformational"" noise which is distinct from the well-recognized transcriptional noise. Therefore, upregulation of IDPs in response to a specific input, such as stress, contributes to increased noise and, hence, an increase in stochastic, ""promiscuous"" interactions. These interactions lead to activation of latent pathways or can induce ""rewiring"" of the PIN to yield an optimal output underscoring the critical role of IDPs in regulating information flow. We have used PAGE4, a highly intrinsically disordered stress-response protein as a paradigm.

Following the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic, the survey acquired a new goal: how do the subjects of the follow-up sampling experience this severe stress situation, and in this experience, what role does physical activity and a salutogenetic sense of coherence play. Austrian women (N = 53) took part in the training program, whose physical condition was assessed before the start of the program, then reassessed after three months and after six months; the organizers also had them fill out the sense of coherence questionnaire (SOC) as well as the Regensburger insomnia scale. After the lifting of the lockdown introduced due to the pandemic, participants completed an online survey relating to their changed life conditions, physical activities, sense of coherence and sleep quality. Results: After the first three months of the training, no significant changes were detected. After six months, the participants SOC and sleep quality improved (Friedman test: p = 0.005 and p < 0.001). During the lockdown, sleep quality generally deteriorated (W-rank test: p = 0.001), while SOC did not change. The women in possession of a relatively stronger SOC continued the training (OR = 3.6, CI 95% = 1.2-12.2), and their sleep quality deteriorated to a lesser degree. (OR = 1.7, CI 95% = 1.1-2.8).

However, there have been few studies related to sleepiness and its associated factors in elementary school children. In Japan, all schools were closed from February to May 2020 to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks. The aim of this study was to identify changes in the subjective sleepiness of pupils during the 1.5-year period and to elucidate factors associated with changes in sleepiness. Questionnaire surveys about pupils' sleep habits and the Japanese version of the Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS-J) were conducted longitudinally at one elementary school in June 2019, January 2020, and June 2020. The average &#8710;PDSS score was 0.94 ± 5.51 (mean ± standard deviation) from June 2019 to January 2020 and -1.65 ± 5.71 (t[498] = 6.13, p < 0.01) from January 2020 to June 2020. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that decreasing social jetlag was associated with decreasing PDSS scores (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.62-0.96, p = 0.02) during the school closure.

cidbckzd,,WHO,End-of-use and end-of-life medicines-insights from pharmaceutical care process into waste medicines management,,,,unk,"End-of-use and end-of-life medicines waste management has been a challenge for public and private managers in different countries. Reverse logistics is a waste management strategy whose application to public pharmaceutical care processes faces legal restrictions and incertitude. Nevertheless, reverse logistics of end-of-use and end-of-life medicines may be both a saving and an environmental strategy in developing countries that manage health under limited resources. How to overcome restrictions to reverse logistics mainly in the context of primary health level? This study aims to investigate the most relevant critical factors for implementing medicine waste management in pharmaceutical care process. The unit analysis is the primary health level process in a developing country capital. Considering the characteristics of the issue at hand, it was designed a qualitative study. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews. The interviewees were key individuals who work directly with the process-from administering medicine to patients to managing waste at the end of the medicine's lifespan or after its use. Results indicated that despite reverse logistics arising from end users is legally forbidden, another type of reverse flow emerged from process analysis. The reverse flow, named reassignment flow, consists of still useful end-of-use medicines exchanged among the 10 government-ran pharmacies and over 140 health centers, where healthcare professionals administer and offer guidance on how to use them correctly. Another result was the identification of the most critical factors in implementing reverse logistics strategies in the public management context. The factors mentioned included aspects pertaining to management, information technology, infrastructure, and government, but they differ from the private context management, in which decision-makers has more freedom. Due to the barriers named by interviewees, the political barriers and complexity of primary health system, results of this investigation point to (i) reinforcing the reassignment flows inside pharmaceutical care logistics cycle, for saving purposes, and (ii) further development of a specific management unit to perform reverse logistics of end-of-use medicines arising from consumers, for environmental purposes. In times of shortage or resources caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, to know the critical factors is a step necessary in overcoming the current restrictions in direction of a well-succeeded medicines reverse logistics, either of reassignment or from final consumers. These results clarify the literature on end-of-use and end-of-life medicines reverse logistics. It also provides managers of 5000 municipalities in the country a perspective on the most relevant critical factors involved in their decision-making process, concerning the reuse of end-of-use medicines or the adequate disposal of end-of-life medicines in the environment.",2021,"de Campos, Elaine Aparecida Regiani; Ten Caten, Carla Schwengber; de Paula, Istefani Carísio",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

Some of these nodules are autonomously functioning such that they can cause hyperthyroidism over time. In this case, surgery and radioiodine represent the standard of care. Nevertheless, patients might have contraindications or be unwilling to undergo these treatments. Minimally-invasive ultrasound-guided techniques, such as laser and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), have been recently introduced into clinical practice as an alternative treatment for symptomatic benign thyroid nodules. Due to their efficacy and tolerability, these techniques have become increasingly available and their usage has been extended also to autonomously functioning thyroid nodules (AFTN). Methods: In this narrative review, we will describe the studies reporting the therapeutic effects of RFA on AFTN, the studies reporting how RFA compares to the other treatment modalities, as well as the current indications for the use of RFA in patients with AFTN. For this purpose, a comprehensive literature search was independently conducted by three investigators on PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from inception up to February 2020 to identify published articles concerning the effects of RFA on AFTN. Results and Conclusions: Current consensus statements and guidelines support the notion that RFA should be regarded as a first-line therapy for non-functioning benign thyroid nodules, while it remains a valid second-line option for AFTN treatment in case of contraindications or patient unwillingness to undergo surgery or radioiodine.",2020,"Cesareo, Roberto; Palermo, Andrea; Pasqualini, Valerio; Manfrini, Silvia; Trimboli, Pierpaolo; Stacul, Fulvio; Fabris, Bruno; Bernardi, Stella",Frontiers in endocrinology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.00317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32528412/,218764699.0

The current study determines the antigen-specificity of the T lymphocytes present during chronic disease and evaluates how blocking CXCL10 signaling affects retention of virus-specific T cells within the CNS. CXCL10 neutralization selectively reduced accumulation and/or retention of virus-specific CD4+ T cells, yet exhibited limited effect on virus-specific CD8+ T cells. The response of CXCL10 neutralization on virus-specific T cell subsets is not due to differential expression of the CXCL10 receptor CXCR3 on T cells as there was no appreciable difference in receptor expression on virus-specific T cells during either acute or chronic disease. These findings emphasize the importance of virus-specific CD4+ T cells in amplifying demyelination in JHMV-infected mice.

Although there are compelling reasons why providing additional micronutrients or conditional amino acids may affect COVID-19-related outcomes, evidence is lacking. The objective of this scoping review is to explore and describe the literature examining the effect of providing additional micronutrients or conditional amino acids (glutamine, arginine) in adults with conditions or infections similar to COVID-19 infection on COVID-19-related health outcomes.

Objective: Determine whether ozonated autohemotherapy is associated with a shorter time to clinical improvement in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Design: Single-center proof-of-concept prospective cohort study. Setting: Internal Medicine ward at Policlinica Ibiza Hospital, Spain. Participants: Eighteen consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection and severe pneumonia who were admitted to hospital between 20th March and 19th April 2020. Exposures: Patients in the ozonated autohemotherapy arm received hemotherapy twice daily starting on the day of admission for a median of 4 days. Each treatment involved administration of 200 mL autologous whole blood enriched with 200 mL of oxygen-ozone mixture with a 40 g/mL ozone concentration. Patients in the control arm received supportive care. Assignment to hemotherapy versus usual care was determined based on the admitting physician on the day of admission, with only one of the three possible physicians prescribing ozonated autohemotherapy Main Outcomes: The primary outcome was time from hospital admission to clinical improvement, which was defined as either hospital discharge or a two-point improvement in clinical status measured on a six-point ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes were clinical improvement measured on the 7th, 14th and 28th day after admission, as well as time to a 2-fold reduction in concentrations of C-protein reactive, ferritin, D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase. Results: The mean age of the cohort was 68 y and 72% (n=13) were male. Nine patients (50%) received ozonated autohemotherapy beginning on the day of admission. In unadjusted comparisons, ozonated autohemotherapy was associated with significantly shorter time to clinical improvement (median [IQR]), 7 days [6-10] vs 28 days [8-31], p=0.04) and significantly higher proportion of patients achieving 14-day clinical improvement (88.8% vs 33.3%, p=0.01). In risk-adjusted analyses, ozonated autohemotherapy was associated with a shorter mean time to clinical improvement (-11.3 days, p=0.04, 95% CI -22.25 to -0.42).

OBJECTIVE Six Brazilian medicinal plant species were subjected to an antiviral screening bioassay to investigate and evaluate their biological activities against five viruses: bovine herpesvirus type 5 (BHV-5), avian metapneumovirus (aMPV), murine hepatitis virus type 3, porcine parvovirus and bovine respiratory syncytial virus. MATERIALS AND METHODS The antiviral activity was determined by a titration technique that depends on the ability of plant extract dilutions (25 or 2.5 µg/mL) to inhibit the viral induced cytopathic effect and the extracts' inhibition percentage (IP). RESULTS Two medicinal plant species showed potential antiviral activity. The Aniba rosaeodora Ducke (Lauraceae) extract had the best results, with 90% inhibition of viral growth at 2.5 µg/mL when the extract was added during the replication period of the aMPV infection cycle. The Maytenus ilicifolia (Schrad.) Planch. (Celastraceae) extracts at a concentration of 2.5 µg/mL exhibited antiviral activity during the attachment phase of BHV-5 (IP = 100%).

As of March 6, 2021, covid-19 has confirmed in 115,653,459 people worldwide. It has also a devastating effect on businesses and social activities. Since there is still no definite cure for this disease, extensive testing is the most critical issue to determine the trend of illness, appropriate medical treatment, and make social distancing policies. Besides, testing more people in a shorter time helps to contain the contagion. The PCR-based methods are the most popular tests which take about an hour to make the output result. Obviously, it makes the number of tests highly limited and consequently, hurts the efficiency of pandemic control. In this paper, we propose a new approach to identify affected individuals with a considerably reduced No. of tests. Intuitively, saving time and resources is the main advantage of our approach. We use contextual information to make a graph-based model to be used in model-based compressive sensing (CS). Our proposed model makes the testing with fewer tests required compared to traditional testing methods and even group testing. We embed contextual information such as age, underlying disease, symptoms (i.e. cough, fever, fatigue, loss of consciousness), and social contacts into a graph-based model. This model is used in model-based CS to minimize the required test. We take advantage of Discrete Graph Signal Processing on Graph (DSP(G)) to generate the model. Our contextual model makes CS more efficient in both the number of samples and the recovery quality. Moreover, it can be applied in the case that group testing is not applicable due to its severe dependency on sparsity. Experimental results show that the overall testing speed (individuals per test ratio) increases more than 15 times compared to the individual testing with the error of less than 5% which is dramatically lower than that of traditional compressive sensing.",2021-08-13,"Hasaninasab, Mehdi; Khansari, Mohammad",Pattern Recognit,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/1f9225ead3edf4c18ff6007eb0914a2990306654.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8362654.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34413547/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0031320321004337; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2021.108253; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320321004337?v=s5,237001296.0

This claim is primarily based on comparisons of life expectancy at birth in England between general and ducal (elite aristocrat) social classes from the 1550s to the 1870s. METHODS: We examined historic childhood mortality trends among the English ducal class and the general population, based on previously published data. We compared mid-childhood to adolescent mortality (age 5–14) and early-childhood mortality (age 0–4) between the ducal class and the general population from the 17(th) to 19(th) centuries. RESULTS: Prior to 1750, ducal early-childhood mortality was higher than the general population. However, mid-childhood to adolescent mortality was lower among the ducal class than the general population in all observed periods for boys, and almost all periods for girls. Among the ducal class, but not the general population, there was a sharp decline in early-childhood mortality around the 1750s which may partly explain the divergent trends in overall life expectancy at birth. CONCLUSION: Health inequality between the ducal class and general population was present in England from the 16(th) to mid-18(th) centuries, with disadvantages in mortality for ducal children in infancy and early childhood, but survival advantages in mid-childhood and adolescence. These opposing effects are obscured in life expectancy at birth data. Relatively high early-childhood mortality among ducal families before 1750 likely resulted from short birth intervals and harmful infant feeding practices during this time.",2021-11-16,"Kendall, Ellen J.; Brown, Alex T.; Doran, Tim; Gowland, Rebecca; Cookson, Richard",SSM Popul Health,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/2b7e710d4a91bd86676f52be69d4223a5d3a27c8.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8606541.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34841036/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100957,244289828.0

METHODS: The GCC maps of a group of children with VFD due to CNS lesions with respect of the vertical meridian in at least one eye (study group), as well as of children with other neuro-ophthalmological problems and healthy children were presented to two masked evaluators, who were asked to predict the patients’ VFD on the basis of GCC damage: the evaluators classified VFD as normal, hemianopia (homonymous or heteronymous) or diffuse. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were included in the study group, with a median age of 12 years. Fifteen had brain tumours and two epilepsy. The mean MD of the affected hemifields was −26.00 dB (SD 7.89 dB) versus −5.51 dB (SD 3.52 dB) for the nonaffected hemifields, p < 0.001.

However, there is noticeable the lack of clinical trials that confirm the efficacy, security, absence of side effects in the short and long term, and the effective doses of melatonin. This point is especially important in diseases with high morbidity and mortality including COVID‐19. There is not treatment for COVID‐19, and several anti‐inflammatory and antiviral molecules are being tested, and different vaccines are in preparation. Although the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic is apparently improving, it is expected new resurges next fall. Thus, looking for an effective treatment of COVID‐19 is mandatory. Melatonin has significant anti‐inflammatory, antioxidant, and mitochondrial protective effects, and its efficacy has been demonstrated in multiple experimental models of disease and in a clinical trial in sepsis. Because COVID‐19 courses with a severe septic response, multiple reviews proposing melatonin as a treatment for COVID‐19 have been published. Nevertheless, there is a lack of experimental and clinical data on the use of melatonin on SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Accordingly, we designed a clinical trial with an injectable formulation of melatonin for intravenous perfusion in ICU patients suffering from COVID‐19 that has been just approved by the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices (AEMPS).

Post declaration, India announced lockdown and various guidelines were issued by Health authorities worldwide for the organizations to function in this emergency aeon. Different organizations strategized differently to respond to COVID 19 pandemic. The aim was to implement COVID 19 guidelines across all the centres of a chain of Eye hospitals in India in short span of time overcoming the challenges. Methods: A SMART strategy was confabulated within the team. There were numerous challenges like lack of time, rapidly changing guidelines, no travelling scenarios, training and educating the staff in huge numbers, rapidly evolving situation, change management, need of increased vigilance, and language barrier at certain centres, sustaining quality assurance and motivating the staff in stressful times. The challenges were surpassed using a power packed strategy, dedicated efforts and team work grasping the available tools and technology from a single location. This template can serve us and other hospitals to respond in a better way for similar future challenges. Results: The COVID 19 protocols were implemented across all the centres successfully. The entire Quality assurance system drifted to online platform and education and awareness methods took the digital thread. Teamwork synergized with the aforementioned things and we came out with flying colours achieving the goals in short span of time overcoming all the barriers. Conclusion: Difficult times bring challenges and challenges teach us the innovative ways to convert them into opportunities. A well planned strategy, best utilization of available resources, team work and continuous monitoring can bring the best outcomes forward.",2021,"Singh, Mandeep J; Verma, Deepika; Banerjee, Tirtha B; Singh, Ankita; Bhatt, Kanika",Indian J Ophthalmol,,#covidwho-1207857,,,,,233447441.0

A review of the literature was conducted to assess the current state of knowledge regarding the effects of creatine supplementation on rehabilitation from immobilization and injury, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiopulmonary disease, and other muscular disorders. Several of the findings are encouraging, showcasing creatine’s potential efficacy as a supplemental agent via preservation of muscle mass, strength, and physical function; however, the results are not consistent. For multiple diseases, only a few creatine studies with small sample sizes have been published, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Rationale for discordant findings is further complicated by differences in disease pathologies, intervention protocols, creatine dosing and duration, and patient population.

As a consequence, the need is increasing for appropriately designed long-term care (LTC) environments and design guidelines for these settings. This investigation presents the findings of a broad literature review on biophilic design and its application to a set of LTC architectural case studies selected for the degree to which each variously expresses key attributes of a set of ten biophilic patterns particularly rooted in the day to day experience of the aged in these care settings: visual connections with nature, non-visual connection with nature, non-rhythmic sensory stimuli, thermal and airflow variability, presence of water, dynamic and diffused light, complexity and order, prospect, refuge, and mystery. The three methodological aims are to conduct an in-depth literature review, to distill the aforementioned subset of biophilic patterns with respect to how the aged experience their built surroundings, and third, to examine these in light of their various expression in recently built state-of-the art LTC settings for persons with dementia and related cognitive disorders. Residents’ engagement with and proximity to nature and landscape, and transactions with biophilia-inspired artifacts was the principal focus. The case studies are further examined in relation to the planning and design of LTC environments in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sociomaterial theory highlights the relationship of humans with sociomaterial forces, including technology. We used sociomaterial framing to review effect on CPD learning outcomes of morbidity and mortality meetings (M&M) when changed from face-to-face (FTF) to VC. Methods: All surgical department staff were invited to participate in a survey about their experience of VC M&M compared to FTF M&M. Survey questions focused on technological impact of the learning environment and CPD outcomes. Respondents used 5-point Likert scale and free text for qualitative responses. De-identified data was analysed using Chi-squared comparative analysis with p<0.05 significance, and qualitative responses categorised. Results: Of 42 invited, 30 (71.4%) responded. There was no significant difference in self-reported perception of CPD learning outcomes between FTF and VC M&M. Participants reported that VC offered more convenient meeting access, improved ease of presentation and viewing but reduced engagement. VC technology allowed alternative communication channels that improved understanding and increased junior participation. Participants requested more technological support, better connectivity and guidance on VC etiquette. Conclusion: VC technology had predictable effects of improved access, learning curve problems and reduced interpersonal connection.

With the world scampering for a possible vaccine, early detection and containment are the only redress. Existing diagnostic technologies with high accuracy like RT-PCRs are expensive and sophisticated, requiring skilled individuals for specimen collection and screening, resulting in lower outreach. So, methods excluding direct human intervention are much sought after, and artificial intelligence-driven automated diagnosis, especially with radiography images, captured the researchers’ interest. This survey marks a detailed inspection of the deep learning–based automated detection of COVID-19 works done to date, a comparison of the available datasets, methodical challenges like imbalanced datasets and others, along with probable solutions with different preprocessing methods, and scopes of future exploration in this arena.

This research underscores the importance of providing options for accessing health care services and diagnostic testing in a clinically rigorous manner. Providing options for patients will be essential in curtailing the spread of COVID-19, and any concomitant confusion caused by the overlapping symptomology of the flu and other upper respiratory viruses. Methods: A survey was sent to patients to collect information related to their experience with testing, guidance, and consults in a telehealth model for SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, patients were asked where they would have sought testing and care had this model not been available, and their satisfaction level with the service itself. Results: More than 1,400 patients responded to the survey for a response rate of 15%. Results demonstrate that patients who underwent testing and received guidance/consults through this model would have visited other in-person clinical environments such as emergency rooms or urgent care centers. Although ∼70% of patients had never used telehealth services before, >90% were highly satisfied with their experience. Conclusion: Many health experts are predicting a second wave for COVID-19 infections around the country. Given the strong overlap of flu and other upper respiratory infections with COVID-19, the winter season could prove challenging both to contain the spread of the virus and to differentiate the cause.

Patient–ventilator asynchrony (PVA) occurs when ventilatory support does not match the needs of the patient and is associated with a series of adverse clinical outcomes. Deep learning methods have shown a strong discriminative ability for PVA detection, but they require a large number of annotated data for model training, which hampers their application to this task. We developed a transfer learning architecture based on pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNN) and used it for PVA recognition based on small datasets. The one-dimensional signal was converted to a two-dimensional image, and features were extracted by the CNN using pretrained weights for classification. A partial dropping cross-validation technique was developed to evaluate model performance on small datasets. When using large datasets, the performance of the proposed method was similar to that of non-transfer learning methods. However, when the amount of data was reduced to 1%, the accuracy of transfer learning was approximately 90%, whereas the accuracy of the non-transfer learning was less than 80%.

Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of CsT in patients with COVID-19. Methods: : A single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted in 1,392 severely ill patients with COVID-19 from Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital. Patients received at least one dose (1–2 mg·kg -1 ·day -1 for 3–5 days) of methylprednisolone were divided into CsT group, whereas the rest were assigned into the non-CsT group. Results: : Of 1,392 patients, 116 were assigned to the CsT group and 1,226 to the non-CsT group. Patients in the CsT group showed comparable mortality rate (1.8% vs. 1.2%, P > 0.99) and viral clearance time (44.5 days vs. 46.0 days, P = 0.48), but longer hospitalization time (21 days vs. 12 days, P < 0.001) than those in non-CsT group. During CsT, the proportion of lymphocytes was lower (14.7 % vs. 18.5 %, P = 0.01), while neutrophils was higher (77.1 % vs. 69.8 %, P < 0.001), than before treatment. The C-reactive protein (CRP) level was significantly lower after CsT (3.1 mg/L vs. 9.5 mg/L, P < 0.001). Furthermore, indicators of liver function (gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) and cardiac function (brain natriuretic peptide [BNP], α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase [α-HBDH], and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]) increased significantly during CsT but returned to normal after CsT.

Clinical laboratories have responded by developing, validating, and implementing a variety of molecular and serologic assays to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This has played an essential role in identifying cases, informing isolation decisions, and helping to curb the spread of disease. However, as the demand for COVID-19 testing has increased, laboratory professionals have faced a growing list of challenges, uncertainties, and, in some situations, controversy, as they have attempted to balance the need for increasing test capacity with maintaining a high-quality laboratory operation. The emergence of this new viral pathogen has raised unique diagnostic questions for which there have not always been straightforward answers. In this commentary, the author addresses several areas of current debate, including (i) the role of molecular assays in defining the duration of isolation/quarantine, (ii) whether the PCR cycle threshold value should be included on patient reports, (iii) if specimen pooling and testing by research staff represent acceptable solutions to expand screening, and (iv) whether testing a large percentage of the population is feasible and represents a viable strategy to end the pandemic.",2020-10-21,"Binnicker, Matthew J.",J Clin Microbiol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/1833ca11439f7d55846c15f31862511be29ef4f9.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7587118.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01695-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32817231/,221220901.0

h286gi6n,,WHO,Adapting and avoiding coping strategies for women with ovarian cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented challenges for people living with cancer, impacting not only physical health but psychological well-being. The psychological response affects the individual as well as the community and can persist long after the outbreak. We aim to assess coping strategies employed by women with ovarian cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Women with a current or prior diagnosis of ovarian cancer completed an online survey which included a query about coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was distributed from March 30th through April 13, 2020 through survivor networks and social media. RESULTS: Six hundred and three women visited the survey website during the study period and 555 (92.0%) completed the survey. Four hundred and eight (73.5%) provided information on coping strategies utilized during COVID-19. Among those who responded, the median age was 58 years (range 20-85) and 150 participants (40.8%) were undergoing active cancer treatment. Commonly utilized adaptive coping strategies included emotional support (159, 39.0%), self care (148, 36.3%), hobbies (139, 34.1%), planning (87, 21.3%), positive reframing (54, 13.2%), religion (50, 12.3%) and instrumental support (38, 9.3%). Many participants also relied on avoidance coping strategies including self distraction (111, 27.2%) and substance use (19, 4.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Most ovarian cancer survivors are using adaptive, problem-focused coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, however many are practicing avoidance strategies as well.

In particular, teaching approaches have been rapidly reoriented to online versions. Although there is a growing body of literature exploring the views of education during this crisis, a critical need exists to document challenges confronting educators in online teaching. In this paper, we explore the online teaching barriers and motivations of 55 in-service teachers in the Philippines, and how these variables contributed to their perceptions of stress regarding online teaching immediately after the pandemic started. Results demonstrated that respondents’ perceptions of interest in online teaching significantly reduced their perceptions of stress regarding online teaching. However, barriers to online teaching, online communication self-efficacy, and the utility value of online teaching perceived by respondents positively predicted their perceptions of stress regarding online teaching. Furthermore, this paper discusses the future perspectives of online teaching transformation based on expectancy-value and self-efficacy theories. Especially, the findings of this paper provide a first look at the stress mechanisms of in-service teachers and initial information regarding stress reduction and professional development of in-service teachers in online teaching. ©Authors",2022,"Ahn, H.

Mortality in the preceding year or years is used to calculate the expected number of deaths, which is then compared with the actual number of deaths in 2020. We calculated weekly age- and sex-specific mortality rates for 93.1% of the Italian municipalities for the years 2015-2019 and for the first 26 weeks in 2020. We assumed the mortality experience during 2015-2019 as the reference period to calculate standardised mortality ratios. Furthermore, in order to compare the mortality experience of males and females, we calculated sex- and age- specific weekly direct standardised mortality rates and differences between the observed and expected number of deaths. We observed considerable changes in the demographics in the Italian population between the years 2015 and 2020, particularly among people 60 years and older and among males. The population is aging and the proportion of elderly males has increased, which was not reflected adequately in previous estimates of excess mortality. Standardized excess mortality results show that in Italy between the 8th and 26th weeks in 2020, there were 33,035 excess deaths, which is only 643 fewer deaths than the official COVID-19 death toll for this time period. A comparative increase in the mortality rates was observed in March among both sexes, but particularly for males.

Antibody sequencing revealed expanded clones of RBD-specific memory B cells expressing closely related antibodies in different individuals. Despite low plasma titers, antibodies to three distinct epitopes on RBD neutralized at half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) as low as single digit ng/mL.

As part of efforts to redress imbalances and achieve equity and mutual benefit, various principles, guidelines, frameworks and models for partnership have been developed. This scoping review maps the literature and summarizes key features of the guidelines for North–South research partnerships. The review was conducted between October 2020 and January 2021.

Twenty-two guidelines were identified published between 1994 and 2021 and originating predominantly in the fields of international development and global health. The themes addressed within the guidelines were aggregated using NVivo qualitative analysis software to code the content of each guideline. Topics featuring most prominently in the guidelines were: partner roles, responsibilities and ways of working; capacity strengthening; motivation and goals; resource contributions; agenda setting and study design; governance structures and institutional agreements; dissemination; respect for affected populations; data handling and ownership; funding and long-term commitments. The current study reinforces many of the themes from two recent scoping reviews specific to the field of global health, but gaps remain, which need to be addressed: Southern stakeholders continue to be under-represented in guideline development, and there is limited evidence of how guidelines are used in practice. Further exploration is needed of Southern stakeholder priorities and whether and how guidelines are operationalized.",2022-01-28,"Voller, Shirine; Schellenberg, Joanna; Chi, Primus; Thorogood, Nicki",Health Policy Plan,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ac1106bc3b49cd989a08e1e266a58740ccd48ba3.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC9006068.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35089994/; https://doi.org/10.1093/heapol/czac008,246388348.0

Three cases of Parkinson’s disease (PD) have been reported as a direct consequence of COVID-19. In spite of the scarce data for establishing a definitive link between COVID-19 and PD, some hypotheses have been proposed to explain the cases reported. They, however, do not fit well with the clinical findings reported for COVID-19 patients, in general, and for the PD cases reported, in particular. Given the importance of this potential connection, we present here a molecular-level mechanistic hypothesis that explains well these findings and will serve to explore the potential CNS damage in COVID-19 patients. The model explaining the cascade effects from COVID-19 to CNS is developed by using bioinformatic tools. It includes the post-translational modification of host proteins in the lungs by viral proteins, the transport of modified host proteins via exosomes out the lungs, and the disruption of protein-protein interaction in the CNS by these modified host proteins. Our hypothesis is supported by finding 44 proteins significantly expressed in the CNS which are associated with PD and whose interactions can be perturbed by 24 host proteins significantly expressed in the lungs. These 24 perturbators are found to interact with viral proteins and to form part of the cargoes of exosomes in human tissues. The joint set of perturbators and PD-vulnerable proteins form a tightly connected network with significantly more connections than expected by selecting a random cluster of proteins of similar size from the human proteome. The molecular-level mechanistic hypothesis presented here provides several routes for the cascading of effects from the lungs of COVID-19 patients to PD. In particular, the disruption of autophagy/ubiquitination processes appears as an important mechanism that triggers the generation of large amounts of exosomes containing perturbators in their cargo, which would insult several PD-vulnerable proteins, potentially triggering Parkinsonism in COVID-19 patients.",2021-05-12,"Estrada, Ernesto",Viruses,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/447ed89ec2a26a6e198485336a7b0016d77eeb8f.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8150712.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34066091/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13050897,235213502.0

Despite being comprised primarily of only four cognate nucleobases, nucleic acids can adopt complex three-dimensional structures, and RNA in particular, can catalyze biochemical reactions to regulate a wide variety of biological processes. Such chemical versatility is due in part to the phenomenon of nucleobase tautomerism, whereby the bases can adopt multiple, yet distinct isomeric forms, known as tautomers. For nucleobases, tautomers refer to structural isomers that differ from one another by the position of protons. By altering the position of protons on nucleobases, many of which play critical roles for hydrogen bonding and base pairing interactions, tautomerism has profound effects on the biochemical processes involving nucleic acids. For example, the transient formation of minor tautomers during replication could generate spontaneous mutations. These mutations could arise from the stabilization of mismatches, in the active site of polymerases, in conformations involving minor tautomers that are indistinguishable from canonical base pairs. In this review, we discuss the evidence for tautomerism in DNA, and its consequences to the fidelity of DNA replication. Also reviewed are RNA systems, such as the riboswitches and self-cleaving ribozymes, in which tautomerism plays a functional role in ligand recognition and catalysis, respectively. We also discuss tautomeric nucleoside analogs that are efficacious as antiviral drug candidates such as molnupiravir for coronaviruses and KP1212 for HIV. The antiviral efficacy of these analogs is due, in part, to their ability to exist in multiple tautomeric forms and induce mutations in the replicating viral genomes. From a technical standpoint, minor tautomers of nucleobases are challenging to identify directly because they are rare and interconvert on a fast, millisecond to nanosecond, time scale. Nevertheless, many approaches including biochemical, structural, computational and spectroscopic methods have been developed to study tautomeric dynamics in RNA and DNA systems, and in antiviral nucleoside analogs. An overview of these methods and their applications is included here.",2022-01-25,"Fedeles, Bogdan I.; Li, Deyu; Singh, Vipender",Front Mol Biosci,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ed6b8373d4d7f32dcc97ae1ca340866c3446e96e.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8822119.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2021.823253; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35145998/,246242432.0
1wmq6adi,,Elsevier; PMC; WHO,COVID-19 Thrombosis: Understanding the Negative Predictive Value in a Pandemic,10.1182/blood-2020-142127,PMC8330212,,els-covid,"A test's negative predictive value-the probability that a negative result is a true negative result-is dependent on the prevalence of the condition. The present pandemic circumstances present us with unique challenges. False negatives in current testing methodology are to be expected.[1] Thus, a rigorous and contextual interpretation of a negative test result is necessary. Blood hypercoagulability and the risk of thrombosis are well documented in cases of the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.[2] The systemic inflammatory response is associated with endothelial upregulation of proinflammatory mediators that lead to in situ thrombi, as well as a generalized disseminated intravascular coagulation. As many as 31% of ICU patients with COVID-19 have been reported to have thrombotic complications. More specifically, cerebral thrombotic complications confined to the arterial bed have been well described.[3, 4]. The case described shows that milder forms of coronavirus infection may lead to other types of critical and unusual thrombotic complications. An otherwise healthy 47-year-old Caucasian woman developed fever and respiratory signs and symptoms consistent with a possible case of COVID-19 infection in late March of 2020. Interstitial opacities were seen on radiographic examination. Two COVID-19 PCR nasopharyngeal tests were negative, and she recovered at home over the following 2 weeks. Three weeks later, she developed headaches, expressive aphasia, and a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The patient was treated for a possible ischemic stroke with alteplase thrombolysis at a local hospital. After subsequent transfer and evaluation, a diagnosis of a left transverse and sigmoid sinus thrombosis with adjacent cortical edema was made. On review of her history, the patient denied taking any form of hormonal contraception, and did not have personal, or family history indicative of thrombophilia. She recovered fully after anticoagulation with enoxaparin and subsequent dabigatran. Prior to discharge a COVID-19, IgG antibody test was reported as positive. Decontextualized and overly simplistic interpretation of COVID-19 negative tests amidst a pandemic is problematic. In addition to the obvious infection control issues associated with the resulting lack of isolation and contract tracing, it may deprive some patients of the opportunity to receive antithrombotic therapy. Prophylactic and therapeutic regimens for hospitalized patients are in evolution, and have been associated with improved clinical outcomes.[5] We are aware that the role of anticoagulation in outpatient cases is not well studied, but we believe it deserves proper investigation.

During the following weeks, at 2 Dutch teaching hospitals, 9 health care workers (HCWs) received a diagnosis of COVID-19, 8 of whom had no history of travel to China or northern Italy, raising the question of whether undetected community circulation was occurring. Objective: To determine the prevalence and clinical presentation of COVID-19 among HCWs with self-reported fever or respiratory symptoms. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study was performed in 2 teaching hospitals in the southern part of the Netherlands in March 2020, during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Health care workers employed in the participating hospitals who experienced fever or respiratory symptoms were asked to voluntarily participate in a screening for infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Data analysis was performed in March 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was determined by semiquantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on oropharyngeal samples. Structured interviews were conducted to document symptoms for all HCWs with confirmed COVID-19. Results: Of 9705 HCWs employed (1722 male [18%]), 1353 (14%) reported fever or respiratory symptoms and were tested. Of those, 86 HCWs (6%) were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (median age, 49 years [range, 22-66 years]; 15 [17%] male), representing 1% of all HCWs employed. Most HCWs experienced mild disease, and only 46 (53%) reported fever. Eighty HCWs (93%) met a case definition of fever and/or coughing and/or shortness of breath. Only 3 (3%) of the HCWs identified through the screening had a history of travel to China or northern Italy, and 3 (3%) reported having been exposed to an inpatient with a known diagnosis of COVID-19 before the onset of symptoms. Conclusions and Relevance: Within 2 weeks after the first Dutch case was detected, a substantial proportion of HCWs with self-reported fever or respiratory symptoms were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, likely as a result of acquisition of the virus in the community during the early phase of local spread. The high prevalence of mild clinical presentations, frequently not including fever, suggests that the currently recommended case definition for suspected COVID-19 should be used less stringently.",2020,"Kluytmans-van den Bergh, Marjolein F Q; Buiting, Anton G M; Pas, Suzan D; Bentvelsen, Robbert G; van den Bijllaardt, Wouter; van Oudheusden, Anne J G; van Rijen, Miranda M L; Verweij, Jaco J; Koopmans, Marion P G; Kluytmans, Jan A J W",JAMA Netw Open,,#327117,,,,,218835658.0

There is currently no effective means of preventing infections by SARS-CoV-2, except through restriction of population movement and contact. An understanding of the origin, evolution and biochemistry (molecular biology) of SARS-CoV-2 is a prerequisite to its control. Mutations in the phosphorylation sites of SARS-CoV-2 encoded nucleocapsid protein isolated from various populations and locations, are described. Mutations occurred in the phosphorylation sites, all located within a stretch which forms a phosphorylation dependent interaction site, including C-TAK1 phosphorylation sites for 14-3-3. The consequences of these mutations are discussed and a structure-based model for the role of protein 14-3-3 in the sequestration and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein's function is presented.

Meeting these oil market challenges induced by the pandemic requires a more accurate assessment of the impact of the pandemic on oil consumption. The existing measurement of the impact of the pandemic on oil consumption was based on year-over-year calculation. In this work, a new measurement approach based on a comparison of simulated and actual oil consumption was proposed. In this proposed measurement model, the actual oil consumption was from the official statistics, whereas the simulated oil demand came from business-as-usual (without pandemic) scenario simulation. In order to reduce the simulation error, three hybrid simulation approaches were developed by combining the simulation technique and machine learning technique. The mean relative errors of the proposed simulation approaches were between 1.08% and 2.51%, within the high precision level. An empirical research on the US oil consumption was conducted by running the proposed measurement model. Through analyzing the difference between the simulated and real US oil consumption, we found the impact of the epidemic on U.S. oil consumption was obvious in April-May 2020 and January-February 2021. At its worst, the oil decline in the United States reached 973 trillion British thermal units, compared to the state without the epidemic. During the entire survey period (January 2020-March 2021), the US oil consumption under the epidemic was about 18.14% lower than that under the normal epidemic-free situation, which was 5% higher than the 13% inter-annual decline rate reported. This work contributed to understand the impact of the pandemic on oil consumption more comprehensively, and also provided a new approach for analyzing the impact of the pandemic on energy consumption.",2021,"Wang, Qiang Li Shuyu Zhang Min Li Rongrong",Energy,,#covidwho-1458854,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.122280,241698005.0
runv08tq,,WHO,Use of the CHA2DS2-VASc score in assessing transradial approach failure,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: Radial access is now considered the preferred approach for coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention because of the low risk of vascular complications. However, radial access failure is not uncommon, leading to crossover to a different access site. The CHA2DS2-VASc score is used to estimate stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. Our study aimed to assess the CHA2DS2-VASc score in predicting failure of the transradial approach, resulting in crossover to transfemoral access (TFA) for coronary angiography. METHODS: We performed a single-center, non-randomized, retrospective study. The study included 1775 patients who underwent coronary angiography with or without subsequent percutaneous intervention between July 2018 and October 2019. The study population was divided into three groups based on the CHA2DS2-VASc score: low (&#8804;2), intermediate (3-4), and high score (&#8805;5) groups. The association between the CHA2DS2-VASc score and radial access failure was evaluated and compared between the groups. RESULTS: A total of 197 patients (11.1%) had crossover to the femoral artery. A large percentage of patients (19.2%) had radial access failure in the high CHA2DS2-VASc score group (&#8805;5) compared with 12.5% in the intermediate score group (3-4) and only 6.3% in the low score group (&#8804;2). The highest crossover rate (42.9%) was observed in patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 8. Higher CHA2DS2-VASc scores were also associated with increased fluoroscopy time, contrast administration, and radiation exposure. CONCLUSION: The CHA2DS2-VASc score can predict failure of the transradial approach, with a score of &#8805;5 having the highest correlation of failure requiring crossover to TFA.",2021,"Tahir, Hassan; Livesay, James; Fogelson, Benjamin; Coombes, Tyler; Patel, Chirag; Baljepally, Raj",Cardiovasc. revasc. med,,#mdl-34140231,,,,,235472516.0

The pressure sensor was fabricated using a master mold, a dielectric layer and fabric-based electrodes. The master mold with inverted cone structures was created using a rapid and precise three-dimensional (3D) printing technique. The dielectric layer with a porous and cone structures was prepared by annealing the mixture of PDMS, nitric acid (HNO3) and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) in a master mold with inverted cone structures. The electrodes were developed by screen printing silver on fabric. A sensitivity of ˜ 530 %kPa-1 was measured for the fabricated pressure sensor at ultra-low-pressure ranges from 0 Pa to 10 Pa. The porous-cone structures provided an excellent deformation and thus resulted in high sensitivity for detecting very low pressure ranges below 100 Pa (135 %kPa-1). As application demonstration, the pressure sensor was sewed inside a surgical mask and it's capability to detect different respiration rates (normal, fast, and deep breathes) was investigated.

Scientists and clinicians must acknowledge that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has the potential to attack the human body in multiple ways simultaneously and exploit any weaknesses of its host. A multipronged attack could potentially explain the severity and extensive variety of signs and symptoms observed in patients with COVID-19. Understanding the diverse tactics of this virus to infect the human body is both critical and incredibly complex. Although patients diagnosed with COVID-19 have primarily presented with pulmonary involvement, viral invasion, and injury to diverse end organs is also prevalent and well documented in these patients, but has been largely unheeded. Human organs known for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression including the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, heart, adrenals, brain, and testicles are examples of extra pulmonary tissues with confirmed invasion by SARS-CoV-2. Initial multiple organ involvement may present with vague signs and symptoms to alert health care professionals early in the course of COVID-19. Another example of an ongoing, yet neglected element of the syndromic features of COVID-19, are the reported findings of loss of smell, altered taste, ataxia, headache, dizziness, and loss of consciousness, which suggest a potential for neural involvement. In this review, we further deliberate on the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2, the neurologic symptomology observed in COVID-19, the host-virus interaction, possible routes of SARS-CoV-2 to invade the central nervous system, other neurologic considerations for patients with COVID-19, and a collective call to action.",2020,"Baig, Abdul Mannan; Sanders, Erin C",J. med. virol,,#506064,,,,,219320003.0

Bacteria use these proteins to actively transport antibiotics to the extracellular medium, preventing the pharmacological action of these drugs. This study aimed to evaluate in vitro the antibacterial activity of 1,8-naphthyridines sulfonamides as well as its ability to inhibit efflux systems of Staphylococcus aureus strains expressing different levels of the NorA efflux pump. METHODS: The broth microdilution test was performed to assess antibacterial activity. Efflux pump inhibition was evaluated in silico by molecular docking and in vitro,by fluorometric tests, and determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The MIC was determined in the association between 1,8-naphthyridine and norfloxacin or ethidium bromide. RESULTS: The 1,8-naphthyridines did not show direct antibacterial activity. In contrast, they effectively reduced the MIC of multidrug-resistant bacteria by associating with norfloxacin and ethidium bromide, in addition to increasing the fluorescence emission of this. The in silico analysis addressing the binding between NorA and 1,8-naphthyridines suggests that hydrogen bonds and hydrophilic interactions represent the interactions with the most favorable binding energy, corroborating the experimental data.

Our study identified pre-intervention determinants of implementation through qualitative interviews, described strategies employed during the first 6 months of intensive external facilitation, and explored patterns of implementation determinants in relation to early outcomes. METHODS Guided by the integrated-Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework, we interviewed stakeholders at low-adopting VHA facilities prior to external facilitation, employed a rapid qualitative analytic process, presented findings during facility visits, and collaboratively created facilitation action plans to achieve goals set by the facilities that would increase M-OUD uptake. The primary outcome was the Substance Use Disorder (SUD)-16, which is a VHA facility-level performance metric consisting of the percent of patients receiving M-OUD among those with an OUD diagnosis. We examined the relationship between pre-implementation factors and 6-month SUD-16 outcomes. RESULTS Across eight VHA facilities, we interviewed 68 participants. Implementation determinants included barriers and facilitators across innovation, context, and recipients constructs of i-PARIHS. Each facility selected goals based on the qualitative results. At 6 months, two facilities achieved most goals and two facilities demonstrated progress. The SUD-16 from baseline to 6 months significantly improved in two facilities (8.4% increase (95 % confidence interval [CI] 4.4-12.4) and 9.9% increase (95% CI 3.6-16.2), respectively). Six-month implementation outcomes showed that the extent to which M-OUD aligns with existing clinical practices and values was a primary factor at all facilities, with six of eight facilities perceiving it as both a barrier and facilitator. External health system barriers were most challenging for facilities with the smallest change in SUD-16. CONCLUSIONS Early impacts of a multi-faceted implementation approach demonstrated a strong signal for positively impacting M-OUD prescribing in low-adopting VHA facilities. This signal indicates that external facilitation can influence adoption of M-OUD at the facility level in the early implementation phase. These short-term wins experienced by stakeholders may encourage continued adoption and long-term sustainability M-OUD.",2021-02-15,"Gustavson, Allison M; Wisdom, Jennifer P; Kenny, Marie E; Salameh, Hope A; Ackland, Princess E; Clothier, Barbara; Noorbaloochi, Siamak; Gordon, Adam J; Hagedorn, Hildi J",Implementation science communications,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1186/s43058-021-00119-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33588952/,231931639.0

Amino acid changes in the RBD have been implicated with increased infectivity and potential for immune evasion. Reliably predicting the effect of amino acid changes in the ability of the RBD to interact more strongly with the hACE2 receptor can help assess the public health implications and the potential for spillover and adaptation into other animals. Here, we introduce a two-step framework that first relies on 48 independent 4-ns molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of RBD-hACE2 variants to collect binding energy terms decomposed into Coulombic, covalent, van der Waals, lipophilic, generalized Born electrostatic solvation, hydrogen-bonding, π-π packing and self-contact correction terms. The second step implements a neural network to classify and quantitatively predict binding affinity using the decomposed energy terms as descriptors. The computational base achieves an accuracy of 82.2% in terms of correctly classifying single amino-acid substitution variants of the RBD as worsening or improving binding affinity for hACE2 and a correlation coefficient r of 0.69 between predicted and experimentally calculated binding affinities. Both metrics are calculated using a 5-fold cross validation test. Our method thus sets up a framework for effectively screening binding affinity change with unknown single and multiple amino-acid changes. This can be a very valuable tool to predict host adaptation and zoonotic spillover of current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants.",2021-03-25,"Chen, Chen; Boorla, Veda Sheersh; Banerjee, Deepro; Chowdhury, Ratul; Cavener, Victoria S; Nissly, Ruth H; Gontu, Abhinay; Boyle, Nina R; Vandergrift, Kurt; Nair, Meera Surendran; Kuchipudi, Suresh V; Maranas, Costas D.",bioRxiv,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/93ffc5769512d7cac79b95e7cf2b9a5e145f4d27.json,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.24.436885,232412177.0

These fungi are found in the environment such as soil, decaying vegetation, and organic matters. Sporangiospores present in the environment enter the human body through inhalation or direct skin inoculation by trauma or ingestion and result in pulmonary, cutaneous, and gastrointestinal mucormycosis, respectively, in immunocompromised hosts. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes, hematological malignancies, high-dose glucocorticoid therapy, iron overload, and organ transplantation are at high risk of acquiring mucormycosis. The second wave of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] affected India severely with the highest number of cases and deaths compared to all other countries. Additionally, the country was affected by emergence of rare but life-threatening mucormycosis. Currently, many coronavirus disease 2019 patients with underlying risk factors such as uncontrolled diabetes, high-dose steroid therapy, and exposure to mechanical ventilation have developed mucormycosis. Inhalation is the most common mode of transmission that results in colonization of sporangiospores in the nose. In immunocompromised host, sporangiospores germinate, and subsequently form hyphae. These hyphae invade into tissues, and produce tissue infarction, necrosis, and thrombosis. Angioinvasion causes hematogenous dissemination to many organs, predominantly to brain, that result in rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis. Clinical characteristics, radio imaging, fungal culture, histopathology, and molecular techniques are the key diagnostic methods. Surgical intervention and aggressive antifungal therapy are the main management strategies. Amphotericin B is the drug of choice for treatment of mucormycosis, whereas posaconazole or isavuconazole is used for step-down therapy and salvage therapy.",2022-03-24,"Sannathimmappa, Mohan Bilikallahalli; Nambiar, Vinod; Aravindakshan, Rajeev",Int J Crit Illn Inj Sci,,,,,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC9008285.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijciis.ijciis_48_21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35433396/,247649614.0

Sabah State, located on the island of Borneo, has previously reported a particularly high burden of disease and faces unique contextual challenges compared with peninsular Malaysia. The aim of this study is to describe the epidemiology of TB in Sabah to identify risk groups and hotspots of TB transmission. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of TB cases notified in Sabah, Malaysia, between 2012 and 2018. Using data from the state’s ‘myTB’ notification database, we calculated the case notification rate and described trends in the epidemiology, diagnostic practices and treatment outcomes of TB in Sabah within this period. The Chi-squared test was used for determining the difference between two proportions. RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2018 there were 33 193 cases of TB reported in Sabah (128 cases per 100 000 population). We identified several geographic hotspots, including districts with > 200 cases per 100 000 population per year. TB rates increased with age and were highest in older males. Children < 15 years accounted for only 4.6% of cases. Moderate or advanced disease on chest X-ray and sputum smear positivity was high (58 and 81% of cases respectively), suggesting frequent late diagnosis. Multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB prevalence was low (0.3% of TB cases), however, rapid diagnostic test coverage was low (1.2%) and only 18% of all cases had a positive culture result. Treatment success was 83% (range: 81–85%) in those with drug-sensitive TB and 36% (range: 25–45%) in cases of MDR-TB. CONCLUSION: Between 2012 and 2018, TB notifications in Sabah State equated to 20% of Malaysia’s total TB notifications, despite Sabah representing only 10% of Malaysia’s population.

Here we describe the methodology, how vulnerability is distributed across the U.S., and assess the impact on vulnerable communities over the first year of the pandemic. Methods: The index combines 40 indicators into seven themes, drawing on both public and proprietary data. We associate timeseries of COVID-19 cases, deaths, test site access, and rental arrears with vulnerability. Results: Although overall COVID-19 vulnerability is concentrated in the South, the seven underlying themes show substantial spatial variability. As of May 13, 2021, the top-third of vulnerable counties have seen 21% more cases and 47% more deaths than the bottom-third of vulnerable counties, despite receiving 27% fewer tests (adjusted for population). Individual vulnerability themes vary over time in their relationship with mortality as the virus swept across the country. Over 20% of households in the top vulnerability tercile have fallen behind on rent. Poorer test site access for rural vulnerable populations early in the pandemic has since been alleviated. Conclusion: The CCVI captures greater risk of health and economic impact.

The association between CRF and prostate cancer is controversial. We aimed to assess the prospective association of CRF with prostate cancer risk using a cohort study and review of the literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed using a respiratory gas exchange analyser during exercise testing in 2204 cancer-free middle-aged men. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence interval (CIs) were estimated. We corrected for within-person variability in CRF levels using repeat measurements. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 24.9 years, 216 prostate cancer cases occurred. The age-adjusted regression dilution ratio of CRF was 0.58 (95% CI: 0.53-0.64). The HR (95% CI) of prostate cancer per 1 standard deviation increase in CRF in age-adjusted analysis was 1.10 (0.95-1.27). The association remained consistent after further adjustment for several risk factors (HR 1.13; 95% CI 0.96-1.33). The corresponding adjusted HRs were 1.24 (95% CI: 0.87-1.77) and 1.28 (95% CI: 0.87-1.88), respectively, when comparing the extreme tertiles of CRF levels. Previous studies mostly reported no evidence of an association or an increased risk of prostate cancer in relation to high CRF. Studies reporting positive associations had short-term follow-up durations (<10 years). CONCLUSIONS: Primary data and a review of previous studies suggest that elevated CRF is not associated with reduced prostate cancer risk. Previous findings of significant evidence of associations could be attributed to increased screening and detection as well as reverse causation bias.",2021,"Kunutsor, Setor K; Voutilainen, Ari; Laukkanen, Jari A",Eur J Clin Invest,,#33763858,,,,,232355912.0
ujh4h434,,WHO,Association of morningness-eveningness preference with physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic social distancing: a cross-sectional survey in Brazil,,,,unk,"Social distancing (SDIST) to contain COVID-19 pandemic spread implies reduced sunlight exposure and social daily life, which delay the circadian system and increase eveningness preference. The regular practice of physical activity (PA) is a time cue that decreased during SDIST. However, it is unknown if decreased PA may be associated with increase of eveningness preference. This study aimed to investigate if PA changes might be associated with changes in the morningness-eveningness preference of individuals practicing SDIST in Brazil. For this, 322 adults (18-89 years-old) regularly living in Brazil between March and October 2020 answered an online survey including questions considering the before and during SDIST period on PA (min/week) and morningness-eveningness questionnaire score. Sociodemographic, SDIST, anthropometric, and health characteristics were also included in the online survey. Participants self-reported an increase of eveningness preference comparing Before-SDIST with During-SDIST scores (56 ± 12 vs. 52 ± 13, p < .0001).

MATERIALS AND METHODS The root canal of 40 extracted human primary anterior teeth were cleaned, shaped and grouped into experimental (n = 30) and control (n = 10). The root canals of the positive (n = 5) and the negative control (n = 5) were irrigated for 3 minutes with 5 ml of 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or saline respectively. The canals in the experimental groups were irrigated for 3 minutes with 5 ml of 1 mg/ml ethanolic extract of S. persica (n = 15) or BioPure MTAD (n = 15) and then flushed with 2 ml of saline. The presence or absence of smear layer at the coronal and middle portion of each canal were examined under a scanning electron microscope (SEM). RESULTS A significant difference (p = 0.004) in smear layer removal between S. persica and MTAD at the middle third of the canal was observed. MTAD solution was as effective as 17% EDTA in removing the smear layer. CONCLUSION MTAD was significantly more effective in smear layer removal than S. persica solution at the middle third of the canal wall.

Scinax constrictus is restricted to the Brazilian Cerrado savanna, while S. nebulosus is widely distributed throughout northern South America. Despite the validation of many anuran species, discriminations based only on morphological traits is quite difficult due to the high conservative morphology of some groups. In this context, the present study uses mitochondrial and nuclear genes to provide a more consistent diagnosis and test the validity of S. constrictus as a distinct species from S. nebulosus, as well as evaluate the position of these taxa within the Scinax genus.

The most frequent thyroid hormonal findings in patients with COVID-19, particularly in individuals with severe disease, are similar to those present in the non-thyroidal illness syndrome and require no intervention. Subacute thyroiditis has also been reported during COVID-19 infection. Diagnosis and treatment of hypothyroidism during the COVID-19 pandemic may follow usual practice; however, should avoid frequent laboratory tests in patients with previous controlled disease. Well-controlled hypo and hyperthyroidism are not associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection or severity. Newly diagnosed hyperthyroidism during the pandemic should be preferably treated with antithyroid drugs (ATDs), bearing in mind the possibility of rare side effects with these medications, particularly agranulocytosis, which requires immediate intervention. Definitive treatment of hyperthyroidism (radioiodine therapy or surgery) may be considered in those cases that protective protocols can be followed to avoid COVID-19 contamination or once the pandemic is over. In patients with moderate Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) not at risk of visual loss, glucocorticoids at immunosuppressive doses should be avoided, while in those with severe GO without COVID-19 and at risk of vision loss, intravenous glucocorticoid is the therapeutic choice. Considering that most of the thyroid cancer cases are low risk and associated with an excellent prognosis, surgical procedures could and should be postponed safely during the pandemic period. Additionally, when indicated, radioiodine therapy could also be safely postponed as long as it is possible.",2021-04-12,"Martins, João Roberto M; Villagelin, Danilo G P; Carvalho, Gisah A; Vaisman, Fernanda; Teixeira, Patrícia F S; Scheffel, Rafael S; Sgarbi, José A",Archives of endocrinology and metabolism,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.20945/2359-3997000000352; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33844898/,233221790.0

Robotic surgeries have never been applied for pancreas transplantation in obese recipients though robotic kidney transplantation did and already proved its value in reducing wound-related complications in obese recipients. PATIENT CONCERNS & DIAGNOSES We performed the first robotic pancreas after kidney transplantation for a 34-year-old Hispanic type 1 diabetic male with class III obesity (BMI = 41 kg/m). INTERVENTIONS The pancreas graft was procured and benched in the standard fashion. Methylene blue was used to detect any vascular leaks. The operation was completed via two 12-mm ports (camera, laparoscopic bed-side assistance), two 8-mm ports for robotic arms, and a 7-cm epigastric incision for hand port. The portal vein and arterial Y-graft of the pancreas were anastomosed to the recipient's left external iliac vein and artery, respectively. Duodenum-bladder drainage was performed with a circular stapler. OUTCOMES Duration of warm and cold ischemia was: 45 minutes and 7 hours, respectively. The patient was discharged uneventfully without wound-related complications. Excellent metabolic control was achieved with hemoglobin A1c lowering from 9% before transplantation to 4.4% on day 120. The patient remained in nondiabetic status in 1-year follow-up.

An understanding of barriers to adherence in these populations is needed. In this qualitative study, we examined the patterns of adherence to mitigation measures and reasons underpinning these behaviors. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 participants from BAME and low-income White backgrounds. The topic guide was designed to explore how individuals are adhering to social distancing and self-isolation during the pandemic and to explore the reasons underpinning this behavior. RESULTS: We identified three categories of adherence to lockdown measures: (i) caution-motivated super-adherence (ii) risk-adapted partial-adherence and (iii) necessity-driven partial-adherence. Decisions about adherence considered potential for exposure to the virus, ability to reduce risk through use of protective measures and perceived importance of/need for the behavior. CONCLUSIONS: This research highlights a need for a more nuanced understanding of adherence to lockdown measures. Provision of practical and financial support could reduce the number of people who have to engage in necessity-driven partial-adherence. More evidence is required on population level risks of people adopting risk-adapted partial-adherence.",2021,"Denford, Sarah; Morton, Kate S; Lambert, Helen; Zhang, Juan; Smith, Louise E; Rubin, G James; Cai, Shenghan; Zhang, Tingting; Robin, Charlotte; Lasseter, Gemma; Hickman, Mathew; Oliver, Isabel; Yardley, Lucy",J. public health (Oxf),,#1072421,,,,,228096139.0

Understanding the transmission dynamics of emerging pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2 and other novel human coronaviruses is imperative in designing effective control measures. Viral load contributes to the transmission potential of the virus, but findings around the temporal viral load dynamics, particularly the peak of transmission potential, remain inconsistent across studies due to limited sample sizes. Methods: We searched PubMed through June 8th 2020 and collated unique individual-patient data (IPD) from papers reporting temporal viral load and shedding data from coronaviruses. We analyzed viral load trajectories using a series of generalized additive models, and the duration of viral shedding by fitting log-normal models accounting for interval censoring. Results: We identified 115 relevant papers and obtained data from 66 (57.4%) - representing a total of 1198 patients across 14 countries. SARS-CoV-2 viral load peaks prior to symptom onset and remains elevated for up to three weeks, while MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV viral loads peak after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV had median viral shedding durations of 4.8, 4.2, and 1.2 days after symptom onset. Disease severity, age, and specimen type all have an effect on viral load, but sex does not. Discussion: Using a pooled analysis of the largest collection of IPD on viral load to date, we are the first to report that SARS-CoV-2 viral load peaks prior to -- not at -- symptom onset. Detailed estimation of the trajectories of viral load and virus shedding can inform the transmission, mathematical modeling, and clinical implications of SARS-CoV-2, MERS, and SARS infection.",2020-09-30,"Benefield, A.

The risk of more severe clinical manifestation of COVID-19 is higher in males and steeply raised with age but also increased by the presence of chronic comorbidities. Among the latter, early reports suggested that arterial hypertension associates with higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, more severe course and increased COVID-19–related deaths. Furthermore, experimental studies suggested that key pathophysiological hypertension mechanisms, such as activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), may play a role in COVID-19. In fact, ACE2 (angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2) is the pivotal receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to enter host cells and provides thus a link between COVID-19 and RAS. It was thus anticipated that drugs modulating the RAS including an upregulation of ACE2 may increase the risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2 and poorer outcomes in COVID-19. Since the use of RAS-blockers, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, represents the backbone of recommended antihypertensive therapy and intense debate about their use in the COVID-19 pandemic has developed. Currently, a direct role of hypertension, independent of age and other comorbidities, as a risk factor for the SARS-COV-2 infection and COVID-19 outcome, particularly death, has not been established. Similarly, both current experimental and clinical studies do not support an unfavorable effect of RAS-blockers or other classes of first line blood pressure lowering drugs in COVID-19. Here, we review available data on the role of hypertension and its management on COVID-19. Conversely, some aspects as to how the COVID-19 affects hypertension management and impacts on future developments are also briefly discussed.

STUDY DESIGN: Anonymous online questionnaire survey. SAMPLE POPULATION: Eighty-one eligible responses were collected in September 2020, including 52 European College of Veterinary Surgeons (ECVS) residents and 29 ECVS Diplomates acting as supervisors. METHODS: Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Fisher's exact test was used to test for significance. RESULTS: A reduction in surgical case load was reported by 82% (n = 66/81) of respondents, with 82% (n = 54/66) of those believing that COVID-19 had a mild-to-moderate impact on training. Compared to supervisors, residents were less likely to feel that appropriate guidance, a safe working environment, and measures to preserve training had been provided (p < .01). Only 45% (n = 22/49) of residents reported confidence with performing teleconsultations. Ninety percent (n = 73/81) of respondents considered online ""case presentations"" and ""edited surgical video footage"" as a positive ancillary tool. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has resulted in a reduction in case load and training for the majority of residents. A discrepancy between the opinions of residents and supervisors was noted on various aspects of COVID-19 related effects. IMPACT: Open communication, as well as the use of additional training tools through digital platforms may help to preserve safe and effective training during times of decreased clinical activity. While this study has focused on surgical specialist training, the results could be applied to other disciplines.",2021,"Alexander, Akash; Radke, Heidi",Vet Surg,,#covidwho-1243683,,,,,235202055.0

Popular polling data based on the feeling thermometer scale can reveal overall patterns of public sentiment toward China, but they do not necessarily capture the multidimensional preferences of the public. This article takes a deeper dive into a series of surveys conducted in Canada that covered a wide range of topics, from trade and investment to international leadership. Two broad conclusions follow. First, public perceptions of China are much more nuanced and conflicted than can be quickly gleaned from the simple dichotomy of ""favorable versus unfavorable,"" especially as one moves from overall impressions to more specific policy issues. Second, misperceptions of China are widespread and may be difficult to overcome, especially among those who already view China negatively. At a time when countries around the world are grappling with the rise of China and its expanding global footprint, failure to account for these features in public opinion about China may lead to misguided policies.

We performed a literature search of published human studies on teleglaucoma on May 12, 2020, using search terms including ""telemedicine"" and ""glaucoma"" that were in English and published over the prior 10 years. This search strategy yielded a total of 14 relevant articles after manual curation. Of the 14 articles, 4 were from the same randomized control trial, 7 were prospective studies, 2 were retrospective studies, 1 was descriptive analysis, and 1 was cost-effective analysis. Seven discussed the common ophthalmologic measurements used in teleglaucoma. Four demonstrated the cost effectiveness of the use of teleglaucoma, and 3 articles investigated patient satisfaction with the use of teleglaucoma. Three articles investigated the correlation between teleglaucoma and face-to-face clinics. Five articles discussed the current use and opportunities of teleglaucoma. When compared to in-person care, teleglaucoma is more time and cost-effective, shows high patient satisfaction and fair to good agreement with in-person care; however, there is great variation in the reported sensitivity of glaucoma screening, warranting further studies to establish its efficacy. For glaucoma management, both the sensitivity and specificity must be further improved before it could be put into extensive use. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to explore the possible extensive application of teleglaucoma in monitoring ""glaucoma suspects"" and maintaining glaucoma follow-up during a pandemic outbreak to reduce the risk of transmission of infection.",2021,"Lam, Pun Yuet; Chow, Shing Chuen; Lai, Jimmy Shiu Ming; Choy, Bonnie Nga Kwan",Surv. ophthalmol,,#covidwho-1164513,,,,,232432794.0

With this paper, we wanted to provide a clear insight into the teaching practices that were established after the pandemic was declared. The goal was to identify the obstacles that appeared in online classes for musical instruments, but also the advantages that, according to the teachers, may be integrated into traditional classes once the pandemic is over. The research was based on a sample of 220 teachers of elementary music schools, combining a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the obtained data. The results have shown that teachers, younger ones in particular, overcome the obstacles of online teaching without major difficulties. As to the particular difficulties they encountered, the teachers most often mentioned those of a technical nature, and the inability to properly work on the techniques of playing an instrument due to the lack of a direct contact with the students. Almost all of the teachers feel that the students cannot improve their skills through online classes as effectively as in a regular class. However, in their future work, the teachers would continue to make audio and video recordings of themselves and their students playing, and practice online teaching when the students are sick or otherwise unable to attend regular classes.

The aim of this study was to report the epidemiologic characteristics of surgically-treated fractures during the COVID-19 outbreak over a six-month period, and to describe the variation in volumes and types of injuries, by comparing them with fractures which occurred during the same period in 2019. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all surgically-treated fractures which were admitted from the January 1st 2020 to June 30th 2020, and compared these data to those of the corresponding timeframe in 2019. The collected data of interest included demographics, such as age and gender, fracture location, time lapse between presentation at Emergency Department and admission in the ward, length of stay. RESULTS: A total of 117 patients were admitted with a diagnosis of facture and surgically treated, with no cases of COVID-19 positive patients. In the corresponding period of 2019, the number of patients admitted for the same reasons was 129. This decrease was more significant in the period between March and April (-30.6%), during which time prevention measures were more stringent. The only statistically significant discrepancy between the two study groups was the mean age, which was significantly higher in 2020. The location of examined injuries were similar in the two study groups, with proximal femur fractures representing the most frequent injuries.

At the same time, the rates of beekeepers affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection were also determined. Approximately 90% of the beekeepers (n = 147) who participated in the survey reported that they were not affected by SARS-CoV-2. Those not infected with COVID-19 (n = 134) had been beekeepers for an average of 17.85 years and they went to their apiary once a week (79.1%). They did not apply any treatment against bee stings (80.6%). Their personal honey consumption per month was between 750-1000 g (41.8%) and they consumed the most pollen among other beekeeping products (58.2%). The number of beekeepers who were not infected with COVID-19 was 21 (15.7%) although they contacted family members infected. There were no statistical differences in terms of AB0-blood types between the beekeepers who were infected with SARS-CoV-2, those who were not infected despite close contact the infected family members, and those who were not infected (P >0.05). Approximately 76% of the beekeepers (n = 147) who participated in the survey and 53% of the beekeepers (n = 13) infected with the SARS-CoV-2 stated that their beekeeping activities were not affected by the pandemic. During the pandemic, the products most demanded by consumers from these beekeepers were honey, pollen and propolis, respectively.

Here, the genome of the pathogenic North American PRRSV isolate 16244B has been sequenced and compared with LV. The genomic organization of 16244B was the same as LV but with only 63.4% nucleotide identity. The 189 nucleotide 5' non-coding region (NCR) of 16244B was distinct from the LV NCR, with good conservation (83%) only over a 43 base region immediately upstream of open reading frame (ORF) 1a. Major differences were found in the region encoding the non-structural part of the ORF1a polyprotein, which shared only 47% amino acid identity over 2503 residues of the six non-structural proteins (Nsps) encoded. Nsp2, thought to have a species-specific function, showed the greatest divergence, sharing only 32% amino acid identity with LV and containing 120 additional amino acids in the central region. Nsps encoded by the 5'-proximal and central regions of ORF1b had from 66 to 75% amino acid identity; however, the carboxy-terminal protein CP4 was distinct (42% identity).

In healthcare settings, handwashing with alcohol-based hand rubs (ABRH) is recommended before aseptic procedures including intravenous injections. We aimed to evaluate the acceptability, safety and preliminary efficacy of an intervention combining ABHR provision and educational training for PWID. METHODS: A mixed-methods design was used including a pre-post quantitative study and a qualitative study. Participants were active PWID recruited in 4 harm reduction programmes of France and followed up for 6 weeks. After baseline assessment, participants received a face-to-face educational intervention. ABHR was then provided throughout the study period. Quantitative data were collected through questionnaires at baseline, and weeks 2 (W2) and 6 (W6) post-intervention. Qualitative data were collected through focus groups with participants who completed the 6-week study. RESULTS: Among the 59 participants included, 48 (81%) and 43 (73%) attended W2 and W6 visits, respectively. ABHR acceptability was high and adoption rates were 50% (W2) and 61% (W6). Only a minority of participants reported adverse skin reactions (ranging from 2 to 6%). Preliminary efficacy of the intervention was shown through increased hand hygiene frequency (multivariable linear mixed model: coef. W2 = 0.58, p = 0.002; coef. W6 = 0.61, p = 0.002) and fewer self-reported injecting-related infections (multivariable logistic mixed model: AOR W6 = 0.23, p = 0.021). Two focus groups were conducted with 10 participants and showed that young PWID and those living in unstable housing benefited most from the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: ABHR for hand hygiene prior to injection are acceptable to and safe for PWID, particularly those living in unstable housing. The intervention’s educational component was crucial to ensure adoption of safe practices. We also provide preliminary evidence of the intervention’s efficacy through increased hand hygiene frequency and a reduced risk of infection.

Although most patients present with mild fever, cough with varying pulmonary shadows, a significant portion still develops severe respiratory dysfunction. And these severe cases are often associated with manifestations outside the respiratory tract. Currently, it is not difficult to find inflammatory cytokines upregulated in the blood of infected patients. However, some complications in addition to respiratory system with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are impossible to explain or cannot be attributed to virus itself. Thus excessive cytokines and their potentially fatal adverse effects are probably the answer to the multiple organ dysfunctions and growing mortality. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms underlying cytokine storm, summarizes its pathophysiology and improves understanding of cytokine storm associated with coronavirus infections by comparing SARS-CoV-2 with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).",2020-10-23,"Zhao, Zhongyi; Wei, Yinhao; Tao, Chuanmin",Clin Immunol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e6658a9244ecb96f82e95165cb7a2f9b2da28ce1.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7583583.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clim.2020.108615; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1521661620307750?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33203513/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1521661620307750,225047763.0

Hence, in addition to early detection and proper management of GDM, treating the associated MDs is crucial. Maternal hyperglycemia and MDs result from a complex network of genetic, behavioral, and environmental factors. This review briefly explores mechanisms that underlie GDM and prenatal MDs.

In this situation college students have to survive with excellent resilience amid various restraints. This study investigates the poor college students’ resilience phase in online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the qualitative inquiry narrative method this study involved 30 college students from Universitas Mulawarman as the participants. The participants were selected through the purposive sampling technique and interviewed via phone call. The analysis process was carried out using the induction and deduction process while the analysis was completed based on the field data and referred to the theory in the deduction process. The research results show that college students experience three resilience phases in online learning: survival adaptation and recovery. The survival stage occurs in the initial months of online learning while the adaptation phase occurs in the first six months of online learning. From the tenths month of online learning students have reached the recovery stage. Following this research finding guidance and counseling services in the universities are required to facilitate poor students to enhance their survivability during this pandemic.

The vast Indian population demands an inexpensive and competent sample preparation strategy for rapid detection of the disease facilitating early and efficient containment of the disease. MethodsIn this study, we have surveyed the spread of COVID-19 infection over Faridabad, Haryana, India for 6 months. We also devised a simple single-step method for total RNA extraction using a single tube and compared its efficacy with the commercially available kits. FindingsOur findings suggest that determining Ct values for samples subjected to the One Pot (OP) RNA extraction method was as efficient as the commercially available kits but delivers a subtle advantage in a way, by minimizing the cost, labor, and sample preparation time. ConclusionThis novel crude RNA extraction method is stable and capable of operating in developing countries like India for low resource settings, without the use of expensive reagents and instruments.

Understanding the relationship between the propofol effect-site concentration (Ce) and patient sedation level could help clinicians achieve the desired sedation level with minimal side effects. We aimed to model the relationship between the propofol Ce and adequate and deep sedation and also incorporate covariates. Thirty patients scheduled for orthopaedic surgery received spinal anaesthesia with 0.5% bupivacaine. Propofol was administered via an effect-site target-controlled infusion device using the Schnider pharmacokinetic model. The pharmacodynamic models for both adequate sedation [Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scores of 3-4] and deep sedation (OAA/S scores of 1-2) were developed using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling. Increments in the propofol Ce were associated with increased depths of sedation. In the basic model, the estimated population Ce50 values for adequate and deep sedation were 0.94 and 1.52 μg/ml, respectively. The inclusion of the patient's age and sensory block level for adequate sedation and of age for deep sedation as covariates significantly improved the basic model by decreasing the objective function's minimum value from 10696.72 to 10677.92 (p = 0.0003). The simulated Ce50 values for adequate sedation in 20-year-old patients with a T12 sensory level and in 80-year-old patients with a T4 level were 1.63 and 0.53 μg/ml, respectively.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between October 2017 and May 2018. A sample of 253 individuals who had experienced a traumatic event in the last two years, was included. Participants completed an online self-reported survey, including demographic variables, trauma characteristics, the German Posttraumatic Growth and Depreciation Inventory - Expanded, the Brief COPE Inventory, and the Event Related Rumination Inventory. An analysis of correlation, a principal component analysis and hierarchical regression analyses were conducted. Statistical analyses were undertaken on SPSS (version 25.0; IBM, New York, USA). RESULTS: After controlling for the effects of personal and trauma characteristics, self-sufficient coping and socially supported coping were found to favor the emergence of PTG. Event-related and recent deliberate rumination were positively related to PTG. Avoidant-focused coping and recent intrusive rumination were positively associated with PTD. Overall, the final models accounted for 46% and 58% of the variance in PTG and PTD. CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm the PTG model and support the central role of deliberate rumination, self-sufficient coping and socially supported coping in the development of PTG. Our results indicate that a similar model of PTD with comparable influencing factors can be assumed: if the individual is stuck in ongoing intrusive rumination and uses more avoidance-focused coping, it might lead to more reports of PTD.",2022,"Platte, Selina; Wiesmann, Ulrich; Tedeschi, Richard G; Kehl, Doris",Chin. j. traumatol,,#mdl-35304016,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35304016/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjtee.2022.02.001,247070779.0

Although generally safe and well tolerated they are potentially lethal in overdose. These two drugs are now candidates for the prevention and treatment of COVID19. In vitro data suggest that high concentrations and thus high doses will be needed if they are to be of benefit, but as yet there is no convincing evidence they are clinically effective. Nevertheless they are already being used very widely and fatal accidental overdoses have been reported. Methods: Individual data from prospectively studied French patients who had taken intentional chloroquine overdoses and were managed in the national toxicology intensive care unit in Paris were pooled. Bayesian logistic regression was used to estimate a concentration-fatality curve. The probabilities of fatal iatrogenic toxicity with the chloroquine regimens currently being trialled for the treatment of COVID19 were estimated from a combined pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model. Findings: In total, 258 patients were studied of whom 26 died (10%). There was a steep sigmoid relationship between admission whole blood chloroquine concentrations and death. Concentrations above 13umol/L (95% credible interval (C.I.), 10 to 16) were associated with greater than 1% mortality. Based on peak concentrations, absolute fatality ratios in the high dose arm (chloroquine base equivalent adult dose of 600mg given twice daily for ten days) of a recently terminated trial were estimated between 0.06% (90kg adult, 95%C.I. 0 to 0.3%) and 4.8% (40kg adult, 95% C.I. 1.9 to 9.7%). This regimen results in peak concentrations above 10umol/L in more than 60% of adults weighing 70kg. The other high dose regimens trialled currently for COVID19 result in peak concentrations above 10umol/L in only 0.2% of adults weighting 70kg.

The idea behind this co-infection modeling is that, as per medical reports, both dengue and covid-19 have similar symptoms at the early stages. Our aim is to evaluate and predict the transmission dynamics of both deadly viruses. The qualitative study via stability analysis is discussed at equilibria and reproduction number R 0 is computed.

METHODS: Medicaid is a government-sponsored health insurance programme for low-income families in the USA. We report the incidence of pregnancy-related cardiometabolic conditions (hypertensive disorders and diabetes in, or complicated by, pregnancy) and severe cardiovascular outcomes (myocardial infarction, stroke, acute heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, aortic dissection/aneurysm and peripheral vascular disease) among Medicaid-funded women with a birth (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis code O80 or O82) over the period January 2015-June 2019, from the states of Georgia, Ohio and Indiana. In this cross-sectional cohort, we examined the relationship between pregnancy-related cardiometabolic conditions and severe cardiovascular outcomes from pregnancy through to 60 days after birth using multivariable models. RESULTS: Among 74 510 women, mean age 26.4 years (SD 5.5), the incidence per 1000 births of pregnancy-related cardiometabolic conditions was 224.3 (95% CI 221.3 to 227.3). The incidence per 1000 births of severe cardiovascular conditions was 10.8 (95% CI 10.1 to 11.6). Women with pregnancy-related cardiometabolic conditions were at greater risk of having a severe cardiovascular condition with an age-adjusted OR of 3.1 (95% CI 2.7 to 3.5). CONCLUSION: This US cohort of Medicaid-funded women have a high incidence of severe cardiovascular conditions during pregnancy.

Both ARBs and ACEIs can facilitate COVID-19 entry into the host cell due to increase expression of ACE2 On the other hand, ARBs have a greater potential to reduce downstream pathogenicity of the SARS-CoV2 via different cell signaling pathways including free radical generation, up regulation of NF-κB pathway, toll-like receptors (TLRs) and pro-apoptotic protein by blocking the renin-angiotensin system more severely compared to the effect of ACEIs The current hypothesis is that ARBs can perform better therapeutically compared to ACEIs in respiratory disorders such as ARDS which is induced by viral infection especially since more than 40 % of angiotensin II can be synthesized by other enzymes such as chymase, cathepsin ARBs treatment can increase the levels of both angiotensin II (Ang II) and the ACE2 enzyme making Ang II a target substrate for hydrolysis by ACE2 into Ang 1-7 which in turn exerts anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant activities These effects are achieved by the binding of Ang 1-7 to both angiotensin-type 2 receptor (AT2) and receptor mas' axis (Mas) and also by its ability to block Ang II/AT1 receptor-induced TLR4/MyD88 signaling thereby highlighting the potential therapeutic use of ARB sin preventing injury induced by COVID-19 virus It is concluded that patients who are already on ARBs medications must continue to use them daily since ARBs have protective effects against COVID-19 virus Moreover, ARB sexert their beneficial effects via their anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidant and anti-fibrotic properties On the other hand, those patients who are on ACEIs medications must change to other safe drugs since ACEIs can facilitate an increase in COVID-19 virus entry into the body as well as reducing levels and protecting effect of Ang 1-7 © 2020 Ubiquity Press All rights reserved",2020,"Hassan, S.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients were examined in the somatogenic phase of acute poisoning with opioid receptor agonists with a wakefulness level 3 to 15 points on the Glasgow Coma Scale. The EEG was recorded in accordance with the recommendations of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. The indicators of electrical activity of the brain were analyzed; computer processing of EEG data, including spectral analysis, localization of equivalent dipole sources of pathological electrical activity of the brain localization of the maximum of the equivalent density of EEG oscillation currents in the neocortex, was performed. RESULTS: Delta-band oscillations dominated in the majority of patients (65%, 20 patients). EEG delta waves were localized mainly at the level of the thalamus; using the method of low-resolution electromagnetic tomography, the localization of the maximum of the equivalent current density of delta oscillations in the projection of the neocortex was noted. Possible neurophysiological mechanisms of «pathological¼ delta waves recorded in the EEG of these patients are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The changes on the EEG in these patients arise as a result of a disturbance of the function of the generator mechanisms of both cortical and activating structures of the brain, while the recorded slow-wave, mainly delta activity, taking into account the recording time (somatogenic phase), may be due to the action of secondary alternating factors (hypoxia and cerebral edema).",2022,"Mikhailov, A Yu; Berezina, I Yu; Sumsky, L I; Scheidegger, Yu M; Goretskaya, T A; Arzumanov, Yu L",Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova,,#mdl-35485071,,,,https://doi.org/10.17116/jnevro2022122041100; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35485071/,248432390.0

Peru is especially susceptible to a range of environmental exposures, including high levels of pollutants, contamination associated with extractive industries, and flooding exacerbated by the ongoing climate emergency. International policies and movements are increasingly calling for a gendered approach to planetary health. However, little research has been done explicitly examining environmental threats to women's health in Peru. We aimed to understand the current Peruvian research, advocacy, and policy landscape at the environment-gender health nexus. Methods: We did in-depth semi-structured interviews in Spanish via online Zoom video conferencing (audio only) with key informants from the Peruvian Government, academia, and non-governmental organisations to explore their perception of environmental health threats and priorities, population vulnerability factors, awareness of projects and collaborations on these topics, and the role of gender in their work. We used thematic analysis to compare priorities, gender sensitivity, and barriers and facilitators to delivering successful women's environmental health projects in the country. Findings: Since July 14, 2020, we have interviewed 16 people, with four further interviews planned to take place before the end of May, 2021. Several interviewees mentioned the detrimental role of weak institutions, multilevel corruption, and the absence of interdisciplinarity and intersectorality across programmes and research. Barriers to successful collaboration across organisations and sectors were clearly identified, including funding scandals related to extractive economies, high staff turnovers impairing long-term programme implementation, and machismo culture in both organisations and communities. By contrast, some interviewees highlighted that successful collaborations were instead built on direct relationships, reputation, trust, and transparency. Women's empowerment was also described as important for successful programme delivery, especially in female-led associations. Some interviewees emphasised the so-called invisibilisation of vulnerable groups, such as girls, teenagers, pregnant women, victims of gender-based violence, and LGBTQI people. Existing health inequalities varied by setting and cultural context and were deeply and silently exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Interpretation: These qualitative findings highlight the multiple and inter-related contextual issues faced by environmentally threatened communities in Peru, and how macrostructural barriers contribute to a paucity of sustainable, gender-oriented, environmental health projects.

Hong Kong is a place, where wearing a mask in public area when a person is coughing or is sick is a normal sight to see. In terms of ethnic minority people, government tried to reach out to them by distributing pamphlets and making public awareness videos in their own languages which were distributed through community NGO’s, volunteers and leaders who all worked together and did their best from their own side by distributing masks, sanitizers together with organizing health awareness programs. This maybe largely because a. everyone in Hong Kong who were present during SARS virus time already knew the drill and knew what they had to do despite the uncertainty b. public are well disciplined in terms of health c. community leaders connect with people and act like channel for government awareness program. Remarkably the most pronounced thing that I observed in all this was, just before the pandemic period, Hong Kong was going through political upheavals but much to everyone’s surprise, Hong Kong people managed to pick themselves together keeping their political differences aside and came together to fight the pandemic first. Wearing mask and social distancing was still an unfamiliar site when I had just arrived in London. Local NGO workers, volunteers in London were seen distributing masks, sanitizers while restaurant people were also seen distributing free foods to ethnic minority people. Not everyone understood or followed the social distancing rules because this was totally new concept to everyone including those around them.

To address this gap, we identified success factors that supported improvements in routine immunization coverage in Senegal, especially from 2000 to 2019. METHODS: We identified Senegal as an exemplar in the delivery of childhood vaccines through analysis of DTP1 and DTP3 coverage data. Through interviews and focus group discussions at the national, regional, district, health facility, and community-level, we investigated factors that contributed to high and sustained vaccination coverage. We conducted a thematic analysis through application of implementation science frameworks to determine critical success factors. We triangulated these findings with quantitative analyses using publicly available data. RESULTS: The following success factors emerged: 1) Strong political will and prioritization of resources for immunization programming supported urgent allocation of funding and supplies; 2) Collaboration between the Ministry of Health and Social Action and external partners fostered innovation, capacity building, and efficiency; 3) Improved surveillance, monitoring, and evaluation allowed for timely and evidence-based decision making; 4) Community ownership of vaccine service delivery supported tailored programming and quick response to local needs; and 5) Community health workers spearheaded vaccine promotion and demand generation for vaccines. CONCLUSION: The vaccination program in Senegal was supported by evidence-based decision making at the national-level, alignment of priorities between governmental entities and external partners, and strong community engagement initiatives that fostered local ownership of vaccine delivery and uptake.

yh9vunig,,WHO,Association Between Hypoxemia and Mortality in Patients With COVID-19,,,,unk,"OBJECTIVE: To identify markers associated with in-hospital death in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 140 patients with moderate to critical COVID-19-associated pneumonia requiring oxygen supplementation admitted to the hospital from January 28, 2020, through February 28, 2020, and followed up through March 13, 2020, in Union Hospital, Wuhan, China. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) and other measures were tested as predictors of in-hospital mortality in survival analysis. RESULTS: Of 140 patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia, 72 (51.4%) were men, with a median age of 60 years. Patients with SpO2 values of 90% or less were older and were more likely to be men, to have hypertension, and to present with dyspnea than those with SpO2 values greater than 90%. Overall, 36 patients (25.7%) died during hospitalization after median 14-day follow-up. Higher SpO2 levels after oxygen supplementation were associated with reduced mortality independently of age and sex (hazard ratio per 1-U SpO2, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.95; P<.001). The SpO2 cutoff value of 90.5% yielded 84.6% sensitivity and 97.2% specificity for prediction of survival. Dyspnea was also independently associated with death in multivariable analysis (hazard ratio, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.24 to 5.43; P=.01). CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients with COVID-19, hypoxemia was independently associated with in-hospital mortality. These results may help guide the clinical management of patients with severe COVID-19, particularly in settings requiring strategic allocation of limited critical care resources.

We have used genetic approaches in the mouse, showing that the WNT pathway is essential for proliferation of all lineages in the gland. We reveal that SOX2+ stem cells are a key source of WNT ligands. By blocking secretion of WNTs from SOX2+ PSCs in vivo, we demonstrate that proliferation of neighbouring committed progenitor cells declines, demonstrating that progenitor multiplication depends on the paracrine WNT secretion from SOX2+ PSCs.

We investigated whether these M-proteins and FLC are detectable in myeloma patients' saliva to evaluate its utility for non-invasive screening and monitoring of haematological malignancies. METHODS 57 patients with monoclonal gammopathy and 26 age-matched healthy participants provided paired serum and saliva samples for immunoglobulin characterisation and quantification. RESULTS Myeloma patients had IgG or IgA M-protein levels ranging up to five times and FLC levels up to a thousand times normal levels of polyclonal immunoglobulins. Despite these highly elevated levels, only two IgG and no IgA M-proteins or FLC could be detected in paired saliva samples. Most patients had reduced levels of serum polyclonal immunoglobulins but all had normal levels of salivary IgA. CONCLUSIONS Immunoglobulin transfer from blood is not determined by levels in the systemic circulation and more likely dictated by periodontal inflammation and the integrity of the oral epithelium. Immunoglobulins secreted by bone marrow plasma cells do not substantially enter saliva, which represents a poor medium for myeloma diagnosis.

Research has indicated that this rate is likely to increase as a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In South Africa, the depression life-time prevalence rate is 9.47%. However, the lack of access to mental healthcare services leads to people not receiving much needed information and care. The growing accessibility to the Internet for South Africans offers a solution for the screening and access to self-help information for depression. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD)-R was adapted for online usage and a website, mddsa.co.za, was piloted in this regard. Aim This study reports on the efficacy of the online adapted CESD-R for use in South Africa by reporting on the reliability and criterion validity as well as the user friendliness of the website and the appropriateness of the instant feedback provided. Setting The study was conducted in South Africa during COVID lockdown level 1 and 2. Methods This study followed a quantitative, cross-sectional research design. A convenience sample of 21 individuals, above the age of 18, with a depression diagnosis and 86 individuals with no mental health diagnosis participated in the study. Participants accessed the screening instrument online at the website. Results Internal consistency reliability coefficients exceeded 0.80. T-test and sensitivity and specificity results attested to the accuracy of the tool. All items contributed well to the instrument, including the items that were culturally specific to South Africa. Feedback from participants indicated that the tool was easily comprehensible, the website was user friendly and the instant feedback provided was appropriate. Conclusion The online adapted CESD-R evidenced excellent reliability and criterion validity and was able to accurately screen for depression amongst South Africans.

The endocrine system ensures that values of essential factors and nutrients such as glucose, electrolytes and vitamins are maintained within threshold values. The immune system resolves local disruptions in tissue homeostasis, caused by pathogens or malfunctioning cells. The immediate goals of these two systems do not always align. The immune system benefits from optimal access to nutrients for itself and restriction of nutrient availability to all other organs to limit pathogen replication. The endocrine system aims to ensure optimal nutrient access for all organs, limited only by the nutrients stores that the body has available. The actual state of homeostatic parameters such as blood glucose levels represents a careful balance based on regulatory signals from the immune and endocrine systems. This state is not static but continuously adjusted in response to changes in the current metabolic needs of the body, the amount of resources it has available and the level of threats it encounters. This balance is maintained by the ability of the immune and endocrine systems to interact and co-regulate systemic metabolism. In context of metabolic disease, this system is disrupted, which impairs functionality of both systems. The failure of the endocrine system to retain levels of nutrients such as glucose within threshold values impairs functionality of the immune system. In addition, metabolic stress of organs in context of obesity is perceived by the immune system as a disruption in local homeostasis, which it tries to resolve by the excretion of factors which further disrupt normal metabolic control. In this chapter, we will discuss how the immune and endocrine systems interact under homeostatic conditions and during infection with a focus on blood glucose regulation. In addition, we will discuss how this system fails in the context of metabolic disease.",2021,"Wensveen, Felix M; Šestan, Marko; Turk Wensveen, Tamara; Polić, Bojan",Vitamins and hormones,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.vh.2021.06.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34420584/,237270086.0

Using a value co-creation lens emphasising entrepreneurship and innovation insights into how the sport industry has changed are discussed. The chapter provides examples from sport management as a technology dependent service management context thereby synthesising the existing literature on sport entrepreneurship and innovation by focusing on the disruption resulting from the covid-19 crisis. The findings emphasise a need for sport entities both large and small to utilise an entrepreneurship perspective when handling crises. This means emphasising creativity and futuristic thinking in order to stay competitive in the global environment.

Based on this approach, we have found that the GBM proved to be a suitable model for making forecasts of stock market index values, as it describes quite well their future evolution. However, the model proposed by us, modified geometric Brownian motion (mGBM), brings some contributions that better describe the future evolution of stock indexes. Evidence in this regard was provided by analyzing the DAX, S&P 500, and SHANGHAI Composite stock indexes. Throughout the research, it was also found that the entropy of these markets, analyzed in the periods of non-crisis and financial crisis, does not differ significantly for DAX—German Stock Exchange (EU) and S&P 500—New York Stock Exchange (US), and insignificant differences for SHANGHAI Composite—Shanghai Stock Exchange (Asia). Given the fact that there is a direct link between market efficiency and their entropy (high entropy—high efficiency;low entropy—low efficiency), it can be deduced that the analyzed markets are information-efficient in both economic conjunctures, and, in this case, the use of GBM for forecasting is justified, as the prices have a random evolution (random walk).",2022,"Brătian, Vasile Ana-Maria Acu Mihaiu Diana Marieta Radu-Alexandru Șerban",Mathematics,,#covidwho-1686876,,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/math10030309,246155758.0

Nonetheless, the TB-related safety of biologics such as adalimumab and secukinumab remains elusive in areas with high TB risk. According to the World Tuberculosis Report 2021, China is the country with the second highest TB burden, but data on TB conversion are also limited. Thus, we performed a retrospective, single-center study to profile the TB infection status conversion ratio among psoriasis patients treated with adalimumab and secukinumab in China. METHODS: Patients were enrolled between April 2019 and February 2021 from West China Hospital, Sichuan University. Baseline and relevant clinical information were summarized, and proper statistical analysis was used under different conditions. RESULTS: Five (5.43%) patients suffered TB conversion in the adalimumab group, two of whom developed active TB within the first 6 months. In the secukinumab group, four (5.26%) patients had TB positive conversion with no reports of active TB. CONCLUSION: Our data show a relatively high rate of TB conversion among these psoriasis patients after mean treatment duration of 17.13 months. We recommend that, in patients who receive adalimumab, TB be reevaluated after the first 3 months and then monitored semiannually for the next 2 years. For patients treated with secukinumab, annual examination is sufficient.",2022-05-26,"Xiao, Yue; Chen, Hui; Zou, Qin; Wang, Yiyi; Gu, Yuanxia; Wang, Jinqiu; Yan, Wei; Li, Wei",Dermatol Ther (Heidelb),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/6086fc61b171f1709d5775c2538e7d71afee2786.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35616884/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13555-022-00745-7,249050211.0

DESIGN Five databases were searched to identify publications which cited policies being implemented by local governments within the 199 signatory cities of the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact (MUFPP) that targeted at least one healthy and sustainable diet-related practice. Grey literature was then searched to retrieve associated policy documentation. Data from both sources were charted against the MUFPP's monitoring framework to analyse the policy actions included in each overarching policy. RESULTS From 2624 screened peer-reviewed studies, 27 met inclusion criteria and cited 36 relevant policies amongst signatory cities to the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact. Most were from high income countries (n=29; 81%), considered health (n=31; 86%), equity (n=29; 81%) and the broader food system beyond dietary consumption (n=34; 94%). Of the 66 policy actions described, the most common involved food procurement within public facilities (n=16; 44%) and establishing guidelines for school feeding programs (n=12; 33%). CONCLUSIONS This review has demonstrated that urban local government authorities are implementing policies that consider multiple phases of the food supply chain to facilitate population-wide uptake of healthy and sustainable diet-related practices.

METHODS: The Hospital Infection Control Committee (HICC) and virology testing records were combined to identify SARS-CoV-2 positive HCWs and study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 over 6 months. RESULTS: COVID-19 cases in our HCWs cohort rose and declined parallel to community cases. Forty two out of 534 HCWs (8%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive with no fatalities. No clinical staff in the special COVID ward or ICU was positive. Significant proportion of non-clinical staff (30%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive. About 70% of SARS-CoV-2 positive staff had likely community acquisition, with a significant proportion having travelled by public transport or having a contact history with a positive case in the community. Twenty four percent of positive staff were asymptomatic and detected positive on re-joining test. CONCLUSIONS: Sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 did not occur in our cohort beyond community transmission. Appropriate PPE use, strict and constantly improving infection control measures and testing of both clinical and non-clinical staff were essential methods for restricting transmission amongst HCWs.",2021,"Pandrowala, A.; Shaikh, S.; Balsekar, M.; Kirolkar, S.; Udani, S.",Indian Pediatrics,,#covidwho-1283070,,,,,231987885.0

Identifying patient subgroups with unique pathophysiology and treatment response is critical to the advancement of sepsis care. However, phenotyping methods and results are as heterogeneous as the disease itself. This scoping review evaluates the prognostic capabilities and treatment implications of adult sepsis and septic shock phenotyping methods. DATA SOURCES Medline and Embase. STUDY SELECTION We included clinical studies that described sepsis or septic shock and used any clustering method to identify sepsis phenotypes. We excluded conference abstracts, literature reviews, comments, letters to the editor, and in vitro studies. We assessed study quality using a validated risk of bias tool for observational cohort and cross-sectional studies. DATA EXTRACTION We extracted population, methodology, validation, and phenotyping characteristics from 17 studies. DATA SYNTHESIS Sepsis phenotyping methods most frequently grouped patients based on the degree of inflammatory response and coagulopathy using clinical, nongenomic variables. Five articles clustered patients based on genomic or transcriptomic data. Seven articles generated patient subgroups with differential response to sepsis treatments. Cluster clinical characteristics and their associations with mortality and treatment response were heterogeneous across studies, and validity was evaluated in nine of 17 articles, hindering pooled analysis of results and derivation of universal truths regarding sepsis phenotypes, their prognostic capabilities, and their associations with treatment response. CONCLUSIONS Sepsis phenotyping methods can identify high-risk patients and those with high probability of responding well to targeted treatments. Research quality was fair, but achieving generalizability and clinical impact of sepsis phenotyping will require external validation and direct comparison with alternative approaches.",2022-04-01,"Li, Han; Markal, Asena; Balch, Jeremy A; Loftus, Tyler J; Efron, Philip A; Ozrazgat-Baslanti, Tezcan; Bihorac, Azra",Critical care explorations,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35372844/,247799202.0

We aimed to examine this association, including interactions with demographic and behavioural characteristics, type 2 diabetes, and other health conditions. METHODS: In this prospective, community-based, cohort study, we used de-identified patient-level data from the QResearch database of general practices in England, UK. We extracted data for patients aged 20 years and older who were registered at a practice eligible for inclusion in the QResearch database between Jan 24, 2020 (date of the first recorded infection in the UK) and April 30, 2020, and with available data on BMI. Data extracted included demographic, clinical, clinical values linked with Public Health England's database of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, and death certificates from the Office of National Statistics. Outcomes, as a proxy measure of severe COVID-19, were admission to hospital, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), and death due to COVID-19. We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the risk of severe COVID-19, sequentially adjusting for demographic characteristics, behavioural factors, and comorbidities. FINDINGS: Among 6 910 695 eligible individuals (mean BMI 26·78 kg/m2 [SD 5·59]), 13 503 (0·20%) were admitted to hospital, 1601 (0·02%) to an ICU, and 5479 (0·08%) died after a positive test for SARS-CoV-2. We found J-shaped associations between BMI and admission to hospital due to COVID-19 (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] per kg/m2 from the nadir at BMI of 23 kg/m2 of 1·05 [95% CI 1·05-1·05]) and death (1·04 [1·04-1·05]), and a linear association across the whole BMI range with ICU admission (1·10 [1·09-1·10]). We found a significant interaction between BMI and age and ethnicity, with higher HR per kg/m2 above BMI 23 kg/m2 for younger people (adjusted HR per kg/m2 above BMI 23 kg/m2 for hospital admission 1·09 [95% CI 1·08-1·10] in 20-39 years age group vs 80-100 years group 1·01 [1·00-1·02]) and Black people than White people (1·07 [1·06-1·08] vs 1·04 [1·04-1·05]). The risk of admission to hospital and ICU due to COVID-19 associated with unit increase in BMI was slightly lower in people with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease than in those without these morbidities. INTERPRETATION: At a BMI of more than 23 kg/m2, we found a linear increase in risk of severe COVID-19 leading to admission to hospital and death, and a linear increase in admission to an ICU across the whole BMI range, which is not attributable to excess risks of related diseases. The relative risk due to increasing BMI is particularly notable people younger than 40 years and of Black ethnicity.

ICEP4 purified compound (ICEP4) is a recently discovered furocoumarin-related purified compound derived from the roots and seeds of Angelica archangelica (herbal drug). ICEP4-related herbal preparations have been extensively used as active herbal ingredients in traditional medicine treatments in several European countries. Extraction method of patent pending ICEP4 (patent application no. GB2017123.7) has previously shown strong manufacturing robustness, long-lasting stability, and repeated chemical consistency. Here we show that ICEP4 presents a significant in vitro cytoprotective effect in highly virulent-SARS-CoV-2 challenged Vero E6 cellular cultures, using doses of 34.5 and 69 μM. No dose-related ICEP4 toxicity was observed in Vero E6 cells, M0 macrophages, B, CD4+ T and CD8+ T lymphocytes, Natural Killer (NK) or Natural Killer T (NKT) cells. No dose-related ICEP4 inflammatory response was observed in M0 macrophages quantified by IL6 and TNFα release in cell supernatant. No decrease in survival rate was observed after either 24 hr acute or 21-day chronic exposure in in vivo toxicity studies performed in C. elegans. Therefore, ICEP4 toxicological profile has demonstrated marked differences compared to others vegetal furocoumarins. Successful ICEP4 doses against SARS-CoV-2-challenged cells are within the maximum threshold of toxicity concern (TTC) of furocoumarins as herbal preparation, stated by European Medicines Agency (EMA). The characteristic chemical compounding of ICEP4, along with its safe TTC, allow us to assume that the first-observation of a natural antiviral compound has occurred. The potential druggability of a new synthetic ICEP4-related compound remains to be elucidated. However, well-established historical use of ICEP4-related compounds as herbal preparations may point towards an already-safe, widely extended remedy, which may be ready-to-go for large-scale clinical trials under the EMA emergency regulatory pathway. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, ICEP4-related herbal drug can be postulated as a promising therapeutic treatment for COVID19.",2020-12-07,"Galindo-Cardiel, Iván José; Núñez, Adriana Toledo; Fernández, María Celaya; Ramírez Labrada, Ariel; Uranga-Murillo, Iratxe; Cabrero, Maykel Arias; Pardo, Julian; Panzeri, Ezio",bioRxiv,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e2b0f9e658062f6e1d5473bad97e8c318030c090.json,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.04.410340,227913724.0

Thus, cancer and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management, stool viral tests, and virus exposure are major concerns in the context of COVID-19 epidemic. In patients with colorectal cancer and IBD, the colonic mucosa exhibits elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor levels, enhancing COVID-19 susceptibility. In some cases, positive viral stool tests may be the only indicator of infection at admission or after leaving quarantine. Without supplemental stool tests, the risk of undetected COVID-19 transmission is high. Moreover, viral exposure during the regular or emergency endoscopic examination should be avoided.

Human islets were cultured or preserved under four different conditions and three media options. Parameters such as recovery, viability, function, islet damage, and gene expressions for markers of hypoxia, and inflammation were assessed after 48-h culture or preservation. Preservation of islets was performed at 4°C in Connaught's Medical Research Lab (CMRL) and University of Wisconsin (UW) media. Islets were cultured at 22°C, 37°C, and 37°C-22°C in CMRL and PRODO culture media. Islets preserved in UW solution had visually good morphology and exhibited higher recovery with less islet damage compared with the rest of the groups, whereas islets preserved in CMRL at 4°C resulted in poor morphology, recovery, viability, and function compared with the rest of the treatment conditions. Culture at 22°C and 37°C demonstrated an increase in the expression of inflammatory and hypoxia-related genes. In conclusion, islets preserved at 4°C in UW solution showed the best overall outcomes after 48 h compared with islets cultured at 22°C, 37°C, or 37°C-22°C in PRODO.

Herein we aim to identify risk factors that may explain the sudden surge of cases and help develop preventive strategies. MATERIAL: We performed a case-control study comparing cases diagnosed with CAM and those who had recovered from COVID-19 without developing mucormycosis (controls). Information on comorbidities, glycemic control, and practices related to COVID-19 treatment was recorded. OBSERVATION: 100 patients of CAM (cases) and 150 patients of COVID-19 without mucormycosis (controls) were included in the study. The spectrum of involvement of CAM cases included rhino-sinus (n=98, 98%), rhino orbital (n=58, 58%), rhino-orbito-cerebral (n=29, 29%). In CAM group symptoms of mucormycosis began a mean of 13.46 days after onset of COVID-19. The mean age of the CAM study group was 51.16 years with 69 males (69%) and 31 females (31.0). The most frequent comorbidities seen in our study population was diabetes (n=113, 45.2%) and hypertension (n=54, 21.6%). Diabetes was significantly more frequent among cases than controls (89% vs 24%, p <0.001). 31% of patients in CAM case group showed a common practise of steam inhalation during covid illness. Most common symptom reported in CAM was related to the eye which included eye pain (58%), lid swelling (54%), eye swelling (47%). Sino-nasal symptoms were nasal discharge (25%), nasal stuffiness (21%), and epistaxis (4%). Other common symptoms were headache (51%) and facial pain (36%). On examination of nasal cavity, crusting and ulceration were present in 83% patients. Eye involvement was present in 60% of cases, of which 27% of cases had vision loss. For definitive diagnosis of CAM, Potassium hydroxide (KOH) mount was positive for aseptate hyphae in 31 patients (31%). Use of systemic steroids for the management of COVID-19, was more frequent in CAM case group than control group (n=70, 70%).

Oligoadenylate synthetase 1 is a type I interferon-induced, intracellular double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensor that generates 2'-5'-oligoadenylate to activate ribonuclease L (RNase L) as a means of antiviral defense. We identified four de novo heterozygous OAS1 gain-of-function variants in six patients with a polymorphic autoinflammatory immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent fever, dermatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, and hypogammaglobulinemia. To establish causality, we applied genetic, molecular dynamics simulation, biochemical, and cellular functional analyses in heterologous, autologous, and inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived macrophages and/or monocytes and B cells. We found that upon interferon-induced expression, OAS1 variant proteins displayed dsRNA-independent activity, which resulted in RNase L-mediated RNA cleavage, transcriptomic alteration, translational arrest, and dysfunction and apoptosis of monocytes, macrophages, and B cells. RNase L inhibition with curcumin modulated and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation cured the disorder.

Search Strategy: We searched PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane, and CINAHL for primary studies and syntheses of primary studies that explore the consequences of labelling non-cancer diagnoses. Reference lists of included studies were screened, and forward citation searches undertaken. Study Selection: We included peer reviewed publications describing the perceived consequences for individuals labelled with a non-cancer diagnostic label from four perspectives: that of the individual, their family/caregiver, healthcare professional and/or community members.

However, these strategies are associated with potentially large time intervals before dose adjustments, which could be detrimental to the patient. The aim of the study was to compare a point-of-care (POCT) version of the APTT to (i) laboratory-based APTT and (ii) measurements of anti-Xa activity in terms of correlation, agreement and turnaround time (TAT). Thirty-five ICU patients requiring UFH therapy were prospectively included and followed longitudinally for a maximum duration of 15 days. UFH was administered according to a local adaptation of Raschke and Amanzadeh’s aPTT nomograms. Simultaneous measurements of POCT-APTT (CoaguCheck(®) aPTT Test, Roche Diagnostics) on a drop of fresh whole blood, laboratory-based APTT (C.K.

Related labour market shocks on Australian residents have been substantial due to business closures and social distancing restrictions. Government measures are in place to reduce flow-on effects to people's financial situations, but the extent to which Australian residents suffering these shocks experience lower levels of financial wellbeing, including associated implications for inequality, is unknown. Using novel data we collected from 2078 Australian residents during April to July 2020, we show that experiencing a labour market shock during the pandemic is associated with a 29% lower level of perceived financial wellbeing, on average. Unconditional quantile regressions indicate that lower levels of financial wellbeing are present across the entire distribution, except at the very top. Distribution analyses indicate that the labour market shocks are also associated with higher levels of inequality in financial wellbeing. Financial counselling and support targeted at people who experience labour market shocks could help them to manage financial commitments and regain financial control during periods of economic uncertainty.",2021,"Botha, Ferdi; de New, John P; de New, Sonja C; Ribar, David C; Salamanca, Nicolás",J Popul Econ,,#1014114,,,,,230421995.0

We performed a meta-analysis to understand the survival and associated complications in pediatric cancer patients as well as their hospitalization, intensive care, and ventilation care (supplemental oxygen/endotracheal intubation) needs. METHODS: A systematic search was performed using MEDLINE, TRIP Database, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO), The Cochrane Library, Wiley, LILACS, and Google Scholar. Additionally, a search using the snowball method was performed in Nature, New England Journal of Medicine, Science, JAMA, ELSEVIER editorial, Oxford University Press, The Lancet, and MedRxiv. Searches were conducted until July 18, 2020. A total of 191 cancer patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were integrated from 15 eligible studies. In a sub-analysis, patients were stratified into two groups: hematological cancer and solid tumors. Outcome measures were overall survival, risk of hospitalized or needing intensive care, and need for ventilatory support in any modality. The random effects statistical analysis was performed with Cochran’s chi square test. The odds ratio (OR) and heterogeneity were calculated using the I(2) test. RESULTS: The overall survival was 99.4%. There were no statistically significant differences in the risk of hospitalization between hematological malignancies and solid tumors (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48–18.3; OR = 2.94). The risk of being admitted to the intensive care unit was also not different between hematological malignancies and other tumors (95% CI 0.35–5.81; OR = 1.42). No differences were found for the need of ventilatory support (95% CI 0.14–3.35; OR = 0.68). Although all the studies were cross-sectional, the mortality of these patients was 0.6% at the time of analysis.

Most research focused on the adverse mental health effects during the initial surge of cases; and yet little is known about approximately how workers are faring 1 year into the pandemic. The objective of this study is to examine stress, burnout, and risk perception in an academic medical system, 1 year after the start of the pandemic. METHODS: HCW across care specialties participated in online surveys in Spring 2020 and Spring 2021. The surveys included questions related to workplace stress and risk perception related to COVID-19. Correlates of stress and burnout were explored using multivariable linear regression models. Professional Quality of Life Scale (PROQOL) questions were added to the second survey. RESULTS: While HCW reported significantly fewer concerns about the risk of COVID-19 transmission to themselves and their families during the 2021 survey (compared with 2020), the percentage of workers who reported feeling excess stress at work or considered resigning stayed the same. One year into the pandemic, 57% of study participants met criteria for moderate or high levels of traumatic stress and 75% met criteria for moderate or high levels of burnout. As compared with participants who cared for no COVID-19 deaths, participants who cared for COVID-19 patients who died had significantly higher traumatic stress (1 to 10: Coef. = 2.7, P = .007; >10: Coef. = 6.7, P < .001) and burnout scores (1 to 10: Coef. = 2.7, P = .004; >10: Coef. = 2.6, P = .036). CONCLUSION: While Although perceptions of risk declined over the course of the year, levels of stress still remained high despite high vaccination rates. Those who witnessed more COVID-19 deaths were more likely to report increased burnout and post-traumatic stress.

METHODS: Five frontline echocardiographers performed and interpreted B‐TTE for 30 patients with COVID‐19 in the isolation wards, and the on‐site B‐TTE reports (OSR) were generated. Then remote consultation over the 30 B‐TTE studies was conducted by two experienced echocardiographic consultants while blinded to the OSR, and the corresponding remote consultation reports (RCR) were generated. Subsequently, the five frontline echocardiographers were convened together to discuss the difference between the OSR and RCR, and to confirm the correct interpretation and the misdiagnosis using a “majority‐vote” consensus as the diagnostic “gold standard”. Afterwards the reasons for the misdiagnosis were given by the frontline echocardiographers themselves. The inter‐rater agreement between the OSR and the “gold standard” was assessed using Kappa coefficient and percent agreement. RESULTS: Complete correctness of the 30 copies of the RCR were determined by the 5 frontline echocardiographers. The reliability of the OSR in the findings of cardiac chamber dilation, left ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary hypertension were weak (Kappa <0.6). The reliability of the OSR in the recognition of major cardiac abnormalities was very weak (Kappa =0.304, percent agreement =63.3%). Misdiagnosis of major abnormalities was found in 11 copies of OSR (11/30, 36.7%).

This research aimed to describe public initial response to Indonesian Government’s health crisis communication in handling COVID-19 Pandemic. This research utilized a big data analysis of data collected from March 2, 2020 to April 7, 2020. A total of 23,229 conversations were recorded consisting of 8,855 on the website, 1,584 on Facebook, 2,904 on Youtube, and 9,886 on Twitter. This analysis shows that in the first two weeks, the discussion about the Corona virus issue was not too massive albeit its negative tones. The third and fourth weeks of talk about Corona were much more pervasive with varied tones: positive, negative, and neutral. The coverage on the news website is much more positive than the responses on Facebook and YouTube, in which the latter held the most negative tones. The increasing number of responses on the website was triggered by the government’s announcement of a National Emergency situation on 30 March 2020. This illustrates that the public needed certainty of information from the government. When information and news were positive or full of optimism, positive responses sentiment would also occur on social media and on website news.

SARS-CoV-2 virus is unprecedented, resistance against number of therapeutics and spreading rapidly with high mortality, which warrants the need to discover new effective drugs to combat this situation. This current study is undertaken to explore the antiviral potential of marine algal compounds to inhibit the viral entry and its multiplication using computational analysis. Among the proven drug discovery targets of SARS-CoV-2, spike glycoprotein and 3-chymotrypsin-like protease are responsible for the virus attachment and viral genome replication in the host cell. In this study, the above-mentioned drug targets were docked with marine algal compounds (sulfated polysaccharides, polysaccharide derivatives and polyphenols) using molecular docking tools (AutoDockTools). The obtained results indicate that κ-carrageenan, laminarin, eckol, trifucol and β-D-galactose are the top-ranking compounds showing better docking scores with SARS-CoV-2 targets, than the current experimental COVID-19 antiviral drugs like dexamethasone, remdesivir, favipiravir and MIV-150. Further, molecular dynamic simulation, ADMET and density functional theory calculations were evaluated to substantiate the findings.

Our simulations of the SARS outbreak are in suprisingly good agreement with published case reports. We show that the high degree of predictability is caused by the strong heterogeneity of the network. Our model can be used to predict the worldwide spreading of future infectious diseases and to identify endangered regions in advance.

OBJECTIVES: To identify risk prediction models for stillbirth, and assess their potential accuracy and clinical benefit in practice. SEARCH STRATEGY: Medline, EMBASE, DH-DATA and AMED databases were searched from inception to June 2019 using terms relevant to stillbirth, perinatal mortality and prediction models. The search was compliant with PRISMA guidelines. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies developing and/or validating prediction models for risk of stillbirth developed for application during pregnancy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Study screening and data extraction were conducted in duplicate, using the CHARMS checklist. Risk of bias was appraised using the PROBAST tool. RESULTS: The search identified 2751 citations. Fourteen studies reporting development of 69 models were included. Variables consistently included were: ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), uterine artery Doppler, pregnancy-associated plasma protein (PAPP-A) and placental growth factor (PlGF). Almost all models had significant concern about risk of bias. Apparent model performance (i.e. in the development dataset) was highest in models developed for use later in pregnancy and including maternal characteristics, and ultrasound and biochemical variables, but few were internally validated and none were externally validated. CONCLUSIONS: Almost all models identified were at high risk of bias.

The dorsal fin of a dolphin is the portion that contains individually distinctive marks and the most commonly visible when an animal surfaces to breathe. The camera captures an image of the dorsal fin whenever it is sighted and based on the number of times an image is captured, a statistical method called capture–recapture is used to estimate the site fidelity and the size of the population in a defined area. Here, we applied these methods to study the bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) between 2017 and 2020 at the Tiber estuary (Mediterranean Sea, Rome, Italy), a polluted major river supplying organic material to the Capitoline (Roman) coastal area and nearby regions. We identified 347 unique individuals, with different patterns of residency (i.e., the tendency of dolphins to remain in, or return to, the study area): 42 were labeled resident, 73 part-time, and 232 transient. Estimating a total population size of 529 individuals and highlighting the presence of animals with a strong site-fidelity, this study suggests developing conservation plans for this vulnerable top-predator species not only focused on areas close to the Tiber River mouths but also extended to cover a broader scale of area. ABSTRACT: Periodic assessments of population status and trends to detect natural influences and human effects on coastal dolphin are often limited by lack of baseline information. Here, we investigated for the first time the site-fidelity patterns and estimated the population size of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) at the Tiber River estuary (central Mediterranean, Tyrrhenian Sea, Rome, Italy) between 2017 and 2020. We used photo-identification data and site-fidelity metrics to study the tendency of dolphins to remain in, or return to, the study area, and capture–recapture models to estimate the population abundance. In all, 347 unique individuals were identified. The hierarchical cluster analysis highlighted 3 clusters, labeled resident (individuals encountered at least five times, in three different months, over three distinct years; n = 42), part-time (individuals encountered at least on two occasions in a month, in at least two different years; n = 73), and transient (individuals encountered on more than one occasion, in more than 1 month, none of them in more than 1 year; n = 232), each characterized by site-fidelity metrics. Open POPAN modeling estimated a population size of 529 individuals (95% CI: 456–614), showing that the Capitoline (Roman) coastal area and nearby regions surrounding the Tiber River estuary represent an important, suitable habitat for bottlenose dolphins, despite their proximity to one of the major urban centers in the world (the city of Rome). Given the high number of individuals in the area and the presence of resident individuals with strong site fidelity, we suggest that conservation plans should not be focused only close to the Tiber River mouths but extended to cover a broader scale of area.",2021-03-28,"Pace, Daniela Silvia; Di Marco, Chiara; Giacomini, Giancarlo; Ferri, Sara; Silvestri, Margherita; Papale, Elena; Casoli, Edoardo; Ventura, Daniele; Mingione, Marco; Alaimo Di Loro, Pierfrancesco; Jona Lasinio, Giovanna; Ardizzone, Giandomenico",Biology (Basel),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/b9b6db1c61253980ea9157c27cb06ebf0f61e2aa.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8066396.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8066396/,

sisurey0,,WHO,Contributions of Health Professions Students to Health System Needs During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Potential Strategies and Process for U.S. Medical Schools,,,,unk,"The COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented challenge to U.S. health systems, particularly academic health centers (AHCs) that lead in providing advanced clinical care and medical education. No phase of AHC efforts is untouched by the crisis, and medical schools, prioritizing learner welfare, are in the throes of adjusting to suspended clinical activities and virtual classrooms. While health professions students are currently limited in their contributions to direct clinical care, they remain the same smart, innovative, and motivated individuals who chose a career in health care and who are passionate about contributing to the needs of people in troubled times. The groundwork for operationalizing their commitment has already been established through the identification of value-added, participatory roles that support learning and professional development in health systems science (HSS) and clinical skills. This pandemic, with rapidly expanding workforce and patient care needs, has prompted a new look at how students can contribute. At the Penn State College of Medicine, staff and student leaders formed the COVID-19 Response Team to prioritize and align student work with health system needs. Starting in mid-March 2020, the authors used qualitative methods and content analysis of data collated from several sources to identify 4 categories for student contributions: the community, the health care delivery system, the workforce, and the medical school. The authors describe a nimble coproduction process that brings together all stakeholders to facilitate work. The learning agenda for these roles maps to HSS competencies, an evolving requirement for all students. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided a unique opportunity to harness the capability of students to improve health.Other AHCs may find this operational framework useful both during the COVID-19 pandemic and as a blueprint for responding to future challenges that disrupt systems of education and health care in the United States.",2020,"Long, Nathaniel; Wolpaw, Daniel R; Boothe, David; Caldwell, Catherine; Dillon, Peter; Gottshall, Lauren; Koetter, Paige; Pooshpas, Pardis; Wolpaw, Terry; Gonzalo, Jed D",Acad Med,,#670940,,,,,220713568.0

A single edge resection or wedge resection labiaplasty with clitoral hood reduction that simultaneously resolves these three issues has yet to be reported. This study investigated the clinical effects and safety of trilobal labiaplasty via a composite incision. METHODS: The single-center, retrospective, observational study included data from patients with hypertrophy of the labia minora and clitoral hood who underwent trilobal labiaplasty. RESULTS: Altogether, 136 patients (average age: 31.6 ± 8.82 years; range: 21–53 years; 224 sides) sought surgery for aesthetic (39/136, 28.7%), functional (17/136, 12.5%), or both reasons (80/136, 58.8%). Overall, 134 patients (134/136, 98.5%) were followed up for 3 months. No serious complications or malformations occurred. Three patients (2.2%) underwent secondary repair surgery due to incomplete bilateral symmetry, 122 (91.0%) scored ≥ 21 points on the Female Genital Self-Image Scale, 107 (91.5%) were satisfied with the cosmetic outcomes, and 93 (95.9%) were satisfied with the functional improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Trilobal labiaplasty performed via a composite incision using edge and wedge labiaplasty to adjust horizontal and vertical hypertrophy of the labia minora and remove lateral folds of the clitoris is a safe and effective method to improve the appearance and rearrange the position of the clitoral hood and clitoral frenulum while preserving the fine structure of the surrounding tissue. This method results in few complications and high functional and aesthetic satisfaction rates. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE IV: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

From 2006 to 2013, data from cohorts of creative adolescents attending a counseling laboratory supported these results. Clinical findings of increased anxiety, depression, and suicidality among creative students in 2014 led the researchers to create 3 studies to explore these clinical findings. Once artifactual causes of these changes were ruled out, a quantitative study was conducted. Study 1, an analysis of mean differences of pre-2014 and post-2014 cohorts showed that post-2014 cohorts scored significantly higher in Neuroticism, Openness to Experience, and Conscientiousness and lower in Extraversion on Big 5 inventories. Regression analyses suggested that while Neuroticism was associated with gender, Conscientiousness and Grade Point Average for the earlier group, Neuroticism in the post 2014 groups was related to complex interplay of all personality dynamics except Agreeableness. In the qualitative Study 2, focus groups of 6–10 students, for a total of 102 participants were queried about the reasons they perceived for increased anxiety and depression in creative students. Increased achievement pressures and awareness of environmental and social problems were major sources of external stressors; perfectionism and desire to fulfill expectations of others were the primary sources of internal stress. The authors suggest that creative students' openness to experience and advanced knowledge made it possible for these students to see the potential for environmental and social crises and respond to their inability to solve these problems with anxiety and depression. Study 3 was a qualitative study that followed up 19 participants from the post-2014 cohort to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and creativity. While the majority perceived a negative effect of the pandemic on their mental health, most also produced a surprising variety of creative works during that time. In conclusion, rapid changes in the lives of creative adolescents since 2014 suggest that scholars focus on current cohorts and the ways in which adolescent personality is shaped by internal expectation and external pressures and global events.

METHODS The CHR was determined in eight runners (mean ± SD; age = 24 ± 3 years) from a series of four exhaustive, constant velocity runs. The RPE, velocity, [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], f b , EMG AMP, and EMG MPF responses were recorded during runs at the CHR - 5 and CHR + 5.

Spain has had one of the highest burdens of COVID-19 worldwide. During this period, Vall d’Hebron University Hospital Burn Center (Barcelona) has faced a unique challenge: supporting the hospital response against COVID whilst continued offering an optimal care to the burn patient. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to characterize the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of acute burn patients who received urgent health care or admission to the our Burn Center during the mandatory confinement period in Spain forced by the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: We analyzed the medical records of burn patients who received urgent care and/or admission to our Burn Center during the mandatory confinement period in Spain (Period 1: from March 14th to May 9th, 2020) and during the same period of the last year (Period 2: from March 14th to May 9th, 2019). Both groups were compared in order to find differences in the epidemiologic profile of burned patients. RESULTS: A total of 350 burns cases were analyzed. A 36% reduction in the number of emergency department visits was identified during Period 1. However, we found an increase in the rate of hospital admissions in Period 1 (20% of the burn cases) compared with Period 2 (13% of the burn cases). Seventy-six burn-related primary admissions were analyzed: 37 patients were admitted during Period 1 and 39 patients during Period 2. No differences were found between the two periods in the proportion of patients that underwent surgical treatment: 59.5% of patients admitted during Period 1 and 61.5% of patients admitted during Period 2. A statistically significant increase was noted in the rate of paediatric (aged 0–16 years old) admissions during Period 1 (40.54%, n = 15) compared to Period 2 (20.5%, n = 8). Among paediatric patients, an increase in the rate of surgical procedures was noted in Period 1 (47% of children), compared with Period 2 (37% of children). Proportion of patients that were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit was higher among burn children admitted during period 1 (46.7%, n = 7) than those admitted during Period 2 (25%, n = 2). Among the 37 patients admitted during the lockdown period, two positive COVID-19 patients were confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: This study gives an overview of the clinical and epidemiologic profile of burned patients during the stringent lockdown in Spain forced by the COVID-19 epidemic. Our data shows a stable trend in the number of burn-related admissions and burn related-surgeries during the confinement period. A significant increase in the rate of burn children admitted and an increase in the severity of injuries in this population is noted. These data must be taken in account in the development of strategies to ensure the maintenance of Burn Centers function in extremely situations such as the current epidemic.

The requirement of patients on dialysis for regular treatment in settings typically not conducive to social distancing may increase their vulnerability to COVID-19. METHODS Over a 6-week period, we recorded new COVID-19 infections and outcomes for all adult patients receiving dialysis in a large dialysis center. Rapidly introduced control measures included a two-stage routine screening process at dialysis entry (temperature and symptom check, with possible cases segregated within the unit and tested for SARS-CoV-2), isolated dialysis in a separate unit for patients with infection, and universal precautions that included masks for dialysis nursing staff. RESULTS Of 1530 patients (median age 66 years; 58.2% men) receiving dialysis, 300 (19.6%) developed COVID-19 infection, creating a large demand for isolated outpatient dialysis and inpatient beds. An analysis that included 1219 patients attending satellite dialysis clinics found that older age was a risk factor for infection. COVID-19 infection was substantially more likely to occur among patients on in-center dialysis compared with those dialyzing at home. We observed clustering in specific units and on specific shifts, with possible implications for aspects of service design, and high rates of nursing staff illness. A predictive epidemic model estimated a reproduction number of 2.2; cumulative cases deviated favorably from the model from the fourth week, suggesting that the implemented measures controlled transmission.

Recently, cytokine storm by the host immune system has been linked with high viral load, loss of lung function, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure, and subsequent fatal outcome. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify potential FDA approved drugs that can be repurposed for COVID-19 treatment using an in-silico analysis. METHODS: In this study, virtual screening of selected FDA approved drugs was performed by targeting the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 and the key molecules involved in the 'Cytokine storm' in COVID-19 patients. Based on our preliminary screening supported by extensive literature search, we selected FDA approved drugs to target the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) and the key players of cytokine storm, TNF-&#945;, IL-6, and IL-1ß. These compounds were examined based on systematic docking studies and further validated using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and molecular mechanic/generalized/Born/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/G/P/BSA) free energy calculations. RESULTS: Based on the findings, Rifampicin and Letermovir appeared as the most promising drug showing a very good binding affinity with the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 and TNF-&#945;, IL-6, and IL-1ß. However, it is pertinent to mention here that our findings need further validation by in vitro analysis and clinical trials.

However, large-scale, systematic comparisons of the TLR 7/8-stimulating potential of genomic RNAs of single-stranded RNA viruses are rare. In this study, a computational method to evaluate the human TLR 7/8-stimulating ability of single-stranded RNA virus genomes based on their human TLR 7/8-stimulating trimer compositions was used to analyze 1,002 human coronavirus genomes. RESULTS: The human TLR 7/8-stimulating potential of coronavirus genomic (positive strand) RNAs followed the order of NL63-CoV > HKU1-CoV >229E-CoV ≅ OC63-CoV > SARS-CoV-2 > MERS-CoV > SARS-CoV. These results suggest that among these coronaviruses, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 may have a higher ability to evade the human TLR 7/8-mediated innate immune response. Analysis with a logistic regression equation derived from human coronavirus data revealed that most of the 1,762 coronavirus genomic (positive strand) RNAs isolated from bats, camels, cats, civets, dogs and birds exhibited weak human TLR 7/8-stimulating potential equivalent to that of the MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNAs.

Although they might be considered a high-risk group for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, the reported impact of COVID-19 in these patients has been reassuring, while the differential susceptibility of distinct types of IEI remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the findings and outcomes of our known patients with IEI who were diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: In a retrospective study from March 2020 to February 2021, four centers in Mexico collected clinical, laboratory, and genetic data from pediatric and adult patients with known diagnoses of IEI who presented with COVID-19, based on compatible symptoms and positive SARS-CoV-2 testing or known household exposure. RESULTS: We report 31 patients with known IEI from Mexico who presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Seventy-four percent were male, 52% were pediatric, and 81% survived. Their ages ranged from 5 months to 56 years, with a median of 17 years. Sixty-five percent had predominant antibody deficiencies, 48% were hospitalized, and 26% required ICU. Pediatric patients had a higher hospital admission rate than adults. Inpatient mortality was 40%, and ICU mortality rate was 63%. Forty-eight percent developed pneumonia, while 36% had evidence of hyperinflammation (4 adults and 7 children). Predominant laboratory features were lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, seen in 70 and 44% of patients, respectively. The serum D-dimer median value was 2.6 (0.5-20.6) µg/mL, and the median highest ferritin value was 1015 (32-10,303) ng/mL. Intravenous immunoglobulin was used in 80% of patients. Other treatments included macrolides (39%) and corticosteroids (29%). Six patients died from secondary infection or uncontrolled systemic inflammation. DISCUSSION: Although impaired immunity due to IEI may be a predisposing factor for severe COVID-19, most of our patients with IEI who acquired the SARS-CoV-2 infection developed a well-tolerated infection and survived, as have more than 80% of worldwide reported patients to date. An impaired immune or inflammatory response may be a predisposing factor for some and a protective factor for others.

High cellular potency and antiviral activity against acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported for (3,5-dichlorophenyl)pyridine-derived furin inhibitors. Here we characterized the binding mechanism of this inhibitor class using structural, biophysical, and biochemical methods. We established a MALDI-TOF-MS-based furin activity assay, determined IC(50) values, and solved X-ray structures of (3,5-dichlorophenyl)pyridine-derived compounds in complex with furin. The inhibitors induced a substantial conformational rearrangement of the active-site cleft by exposing a central buried tryptophan residue.

ih96keq0,,WHO,Fixing Attached Cells for Staining,,,,unk,"For cell staining, fixation methods decrease generally into two classes, organic solvents and cross-linking reagents. Organic solvents such as alcohols and acetone remove lipids and dehydrate the cells, precipitating the proteins on the cellular architecture. Cross-linking reagents such as paraformaldehyde form intermolecular bridges, normally through free amino groups, thus creating a network of linked antigens. Choosing between fixation in organic solvents or cross-linking agents is empirical. There are no general rules to decide between the two and both procedures are described here. Both methods may denature protein antigens, and for this reason, antibodies prepared against denatured proteins may be more useful for cell staining. In some instances, anti-denatured-protein antibodies are the only ones that can work. Fixation in protein cross-linking reagents such as paraformaldehyde or glutaraldehyde preserves cell structure better than organic solvents but may reduce the antigenicity of some cell components. Simple fixation with paraformaldehyde or glutaraldehyde does not allow the antibody to access the specimen and therefore is followed by a permeabilization step using an organic solvent or nonionic detergent. Using the organic solvent is easy, but it can destroy certain elements of the cell architecture, although prior fixation with paraformaldehyde does help to preserve the cellular structure. If preservation of cell structure is important, the best first choice would be to use a nonionic detergent.",2020,"Rodig, Scott J",Cold Spring Harb Protoc,,#32747585,,,,,220965542.0

However, sex differences in dementia incidence is controversial with conflicting reports showing women with higher, lower, or similar incidence. Source of difference may be due to clinical setting and lack of consideration of competing risk of death. We examined dementia incidence in a sample of the national Veteran population to determine differences by sex. METHODS: We examined data from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the largest integrated health care system in the U.S. We studied 947,797 veterans aged ≥55 years (mean age: 69.9±8.4, 3% female) evaluated in the VHA from October 1, 1999 to September 30, 2019. We estimated age-adjusted incidence rates of dementia (International Classification of Diseases, 9 th and 10 th Edition codes) by sex, and used Fine-Gray proportional hazards models with age as time scale to examine time to diagnosis, accounting for competing risk of death. RESULTS: During the follow-up (mean 8.4 years), 11.3% (n = 106,977, 11.4 % men and 8.0% women) of Veterans developed dementia. Age-adjusted incidence was 12.6/1000 person-years for men and 12.7/1000 person-years for women. Compared to male Veterans, risk dementia was slightly higher among females (HR=1.15 95% CI 1.10-1.20), and on average, female Veterans developed dementia 0.2 years earlier than male Veterans. After additional adjustment for race, education, medical, and psychiatric conditions, results were similar.

This work examined three parts of intestine from twelve gilts experimentally infected with PCV2-spiked semen, six vaccinated (V group) and six unvaccinated (NV group) against PCV2, 29 and 53 days post infection (DPI). An immunohistochemical investigation for IgA-, IgG- and IgM-antibody bearing plasma cells (PCs) was run on intestinal samples coupled with a sandwich immunohistochemical method to reveal anti-PCV2 antibody-secreting PCs. Plasma cell density was compared in the two groups of animals at 29 and 53 DPI. The IgA, IgG and IgM PC density did not differ between groups but displayed an increase from the upper (villus) to the lower part of the crypts while a decreasing trend in PC density was identified from duodenum to ileum. In the NV group, no increase in anti-PCV2 PC density was demonstrable in the two sampling moment: the amounts of lamina propria PCV2-specific antibody-producing PCs remained constant, 10.55 ± 4.24 and 10.06 ± 5.01 at 29 DPI and 53 DPI, respectively. In the V group a significant increase in PCV2-specific antibody-producing PCs was observed over time. The amounts of PCV2-specific antibody-producing PCs increased from 9.37 ± 13.36 at 29 DPI to 18.76 ± 15.83 at 53 DPI. The data on IgA, IgM and IgG PC counts can be considered reference values in a population of adult pigs. The sandwich method can be proposed as a technique able to identify specific antibody-secreting PCs in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. A practical application of the sandwich method is the demonstration of a “booster-like” response of the lamina propria in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated animals.

The aim of this randomized trial was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SPLS in uncomplicated appendicitis. METHODS Between December 2009 and November 2010, 194 patients with radiologically diagnosed acute appendicitis were randomly allocated to undergo either SPLS or multiport laparoscopic surgery (MPLS). Patients with intraoperative findings of perforated appendicitis were excluded from the analysis. The primary endpoint was perioperative morbidity. All data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS Fourteen cases were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 180 patients, 90 were assigned to the SPLS group, and 90 to the MPLS group. Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the groups. In the SPLS group, the rate of conversion to MPLS was 11.1%. The operation time was 14.5 min longer for SPLS than for MPLS (p < 0.01), but there was no between-group difference in the rate of intraoperative complications (SPLS, 4.4%; MPLS, 0%; p = 0.12) or postoperative complications (SPLS, 4.4%; MPLS, 2.2%; p = 0.68). Compared to the MPLS group, the SPLS group had higher cumulative dose of analgesics (tramadol; 73.9 vs. 51.7 mg, p = 0.04), longer postoperative time to first passage of flatus (27.7 vs. 20.1 h, p < 0.01), longer postoperative hospitalization (2.5 vs. 2.1 days, p < 0.05), and higher total cost (1826.9 vs. 1662.4 USD, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS This randomized trial indicates that, compared to MPLS, SPLS does not increase the rate of perioperative or postoperative complications in uncomplicated appendicitis, but may have disadvantages such as increased operation time, later postoperative functional recovery, longer hospital stay, and higher costs, although the difference is minimal (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01007318).",2018,"Kang, Byung Mo; Choi, Sung Il; Kim, Bum-Soo; Lee, Suk-Hwan",Surgical endoscopy,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-018-6028-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29340826/,21556286.0

METHODOLOGY We compared POC-Ab with rRT-PCR results among patients in a tertiary hospital from January to March 2020 in Bandung, Indonesia. We selected presumptive COVID-19 patients with positive rRT-PCR consecutively and 20 patients with negative rRT-PCR results were selected randomly from the same group of patients as controls. We described the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) with corresponding 95% confidence interval using serum and capillary blood samples. We also tested POC-Ab using non-COVID-19 (confirmed dengue and typhoid) patients' sera. RESULTS Twenty-seven patients with positive rRT-PCR result and 20 negative controls were included (68.1% males, mean age 46 (SD: 15.4)). Using the serum, the sensitivity of the POC-Ab was 63.0% (42.4-80.6), specificity was 95.0% (75.1-99.9), PPV was 94.4% (72.7-99.8), NPV was 65.5% (45.7-82.1). A subset of 20 patients was tested using a capillary blood sample. The accuracy of the capillary blood sample is lower compared to serum (50.0% vs. 78.7%). None of the non-COVID-19 sera tested were reactive. CONCLUSIONS POC-Ab for COVID-19 has a high specificity with no false-positive result in non-COVID-19 sera. Therefore, it can be used to guide diagnostic among symptomatic patients in resource limited settings. Given its low sensitivity, patients with high suspicion of COVID-19 but non-reactive result should be prioritized for rRT-PCR testing.",2021-03-07,"Fauziah, Nisa; Koesoemadinata, Raspati C; Andriyoko, Basti; Faridah, Lia; Riswari, Silvita F; Widyatmoko, Leonardus; Prihatni, Delita; Ekawardhani, Savira; Fibriani, Azzania; Rachmawati, Emma; Ristandi, Ryan B; Alamanda, Cut Nc; Prodjosoewojo, Susantina; Lestari, Bony W; Santoso, Ida P",Journal of infection in developing countries,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.13370; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33690206/,232188239.0

An important consideration for the clinical application of metabolomics are the different anticoagulants utilized for sample collection. Most studies that have characterized differences in metabolite levels in various blood collection tubes have focused on single analytes. We define analyte levels on a global metabolomics platform following blood sampling using five different, but commonly used, clinical laboratory blood collection tubes (i.e., plasma anticoagulated with either EDTA, lithium heparin or sodium citrate, along with no additive (serum), and EDTA anticoagulated whole blood). METHODS: Using an untargeted metabolomics platform we analyzed five sample types after all had been collected and stored at -80°C. The biochemical composition was determined and differences between the samples established using matched-pair t-tests. RESULTS: We identified 1,117 biochemicals across all samples and detected a mean of 1,036 in the sample groups. Compared to the levels of metabolites in EDTA plasma, the number of biochemicals present at statistically significant different levels (p<0.05) ranged from 452 (serum) to 917 (whole blood). Several metabolites linked to screening assays for rare diseases including acylcarnitines, bilirubin and heme metabolites, nucleosides, and redox balance metabolites varied significantly across the sample collection types. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the widespread effects and importance of using consistent additives for assessing small molecule levels in clinical metabolomics. The biochemistry that occurs during the blood collection process creates a reproducible signal that can identify specimens collected with different anticoagulants in metabolomic studies. IMPACT STATEMENT: In this manuscript, normal/healthy donors had peripheral blood collected using multiple anticoagulants as well as serum during a fasted blood draw. Global metabolomics is a new technology being utilized to draw clinical conclusions and we interrogated the effects of different anticoagulants on the levels of biochemicals from each of the donors.

So far, various engineering strategies have been recruited to improve the production efficiency of this cell line such as apoptosis engineering. Previously, it is reported that the caspase-7 deficiency in CHO cells reduces the cell proliferation rate. But the effect of this reduction on the CHO cell productivity remained unclear. Hence, in the study at hand the effect of caspase-7 deficiency was assessed on the cell growth, viability and protein expression. In addition, the enzymatic activity of caspase-3 was investigated in the absence of caspase-7. RESULTS: Findings showed that in the absence of caspase-7, both cell growth and cell viability were decreased. Cell cycle analysis illustrated that the CHO knockout (CHO-KO) cells experienced a cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase. This cell cycle arrest resulted in a 1.7-fold increase in the expression of luciferase in CHO-KO cells compared to parenteral cells. Furthermore, in the apoptotic situation the enzymatic activity of caspase-3 in CHO-KO cells was approximately 3 times more than CHO-K1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings represented that; however, caspase-7 deficiency reduces the cell proliferation rate but the resulted cell cycle arrest leads to the enhancement of recombinant protein expression. Moreover, increasing in the caspase-3 enzymatic activity compensates the absence of caspase-7 in the caspase cascade of apoptosis.",2022-01-11,"Safari, Fatemeh; Akbari, Bahman",Biol Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/74a00ef4ab8d27e94e655907c3430cc676736901.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8753818.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8753818/,

RESULTS: The rate of midwives experiencing depression was found to be 9.6%. The mean score of MJSQ was 64.59±13.29, while the mean scores for the sub-dimensions of MBI were: emotional burnout 18.57±6.65, decrease in sense of personal accomplishment 21.65±3.93, and depersonalization 6.25±3.86. It was found that midwives who did not experience depression (90.4%) had a higher level of job satisfaction and a higher sense of personal accomplishment (p<0.05). On the other hand, midwives experiencing depression (9.6%) had higher levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. It was found that there was a negative weak relationship between BDI and job satisfaction and personal accomplishment, and a positive weak relationship between BDI and emotional exhaustion (p<0.05).

The objective of this work was to characterize the IFN-alpha-producing cells (IPC) in tissues of TGEV-infected piglets. Caesarean-derived colostrum-deprived piglets were infected orally with the TGEV virulent Miller strain and IPC were characterized in situ by immunohistochemistry, using a rabbit anti-pig IFN-alpha antiserum. IPC were almost exclusively detected in intestinal tissues and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), as early as 6 h post inoculation (p.i.), with a peak at 12-18 h. They disappeared by 24 h. IPC were localized between enterocytes in the small intestine epithelial layer, in the lamina propria, around the Peyer's patches and, at highest frequency, in MLN. Very few IPC were present in the spleen and popliteal lymph nodes of infected piglets. Double immunohistochemical staining for IFN-alpha and leukocyte markers on MLN cryosections showed that IPC were mainly Swine Leukocyte Antigen (SLA) class II positive, and were not stained by an anti-macrophage (SWC3a) MAb. In addition, double staining with anti-TGEV and anti-IFN-alpha MAbs showed that viral antigens were present in MLN, close to IPC. These results show for the first time the presence of IPC in gut mucosa and gut-associated lymphoid tissues in response to an enteropathogenic virus. Moreover, this work shows that IFN-alpha released in serum is likely to originate almost exclusively from gut IPC triggered locally by viral antigens to produce IFN-alpha, since there were very few IPC in spleen or peripheral lymph nodes. MHC class II molecule expression by gut-associated IPC suggests that these cells may be the in vivo mucosal counterparts of the dendritic cells recently shown to produce IFN-alpha after in vitro viral induction.",2001,"Riffault, S; Carrat, C; van Reeth, K; Pensaert, M; Charley, B",Veterinary research,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11254179/,31729165.0

A cough is at the efferent end of a complex reflex arc and, due to its well-known mechanical respiratory cleaning function, usually the first symptom prompting a pneumological clarification. However, the chemical and mechanical afferent neuronal parts of the reflex, the cough receptors, are distributed over a variety of organ systems, some of which directly and indirectly affect the heart. Cardiology therefore plays a central role in the clarification of coughs. In cardiology, a cough is most frequently caused by acute and chronic heart failure resulting from different types of cardiomyopathies. It can, however, be caused by other pathologies as well. The connection between cough and cardiac arrhythmia is interesting, although cough can be cause, consequence and therapy. Last but not least, almost all drugs frequently prescribed in cardiology can cause cough in one way or another. In addition, a cough is the current number 1 warning sign when it comes to COVID-19 infection. On the one hand, it must be differentiated from cardiac-induced coughs, but on the other hand it can also be closely related to them.",2021,"Pavlicek-Bahlo, Maryam; Hunziker, Lukas",Therapeutische Umschau.

c73kjd4a,,WHO,The Patterns and Associated Cost of Serologic Testing for Helicobacter pylori in the U.S. Military Health System,,,,unk,"INTRODUCTION: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection affects about half of the world's population and can lead to multiple complications if left untreated. Testing for H. pylori infection in appropriate patients with prompt treatment followed by the testing of eradication is the standard of care in the United States. Active Duty Service members (ADSMs) in the U.S. military are a unique patient population that may be at higher risk for acquiring H. pylori infection given frequent deployments to developing countries. Noninvasive diagnostic strategies include the urea breath test, the stool antigen test, and serologic testing, which include H. pylori immunoglobulin M (IgM), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. Among noninvasive methods, the least sensitive is serology, and although there is clinical utility in testing for H. pylori IgG antibodies, H. pylori IgA or IgM antibodies have limited clinical utility. Despite this, H. pylori IgA and IgM antibodies are still widely ordered across the Military Health System. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to determine how frequently this testing is being ordered and the associated cost, we conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study of H. pylori serologic testing utilization in the MHS from October 2015 to September 2018 in adult patients using the MHS Data Repository. All H. pylori IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies, H. pylori stool antigen tests, and H. pylori urea breath tests were queried during this time period across all ADSMs, retirees, and ADSM dependents for all adults. Cost information was obtained from LabCorp, and the institutional price used for cost analysis was the same throughout all military treatment facilities in the Department of Defense (DOD). RESULTS: We discovered that over a 3-yr period, 1,916 H. pylori IgA and 2,492 IgM antibodies were ordered. In total, the DOD spent close to $400,000 on antibody-based testing for H. pylori not accounting for indirect associated costs like personnel, supplies, repeat testing, as well as the costs of delayed diagnosis and associated complications. CONCLUSION: H. pylori IgM and IgA have limited clinical utility, are inaccurate, and are costly to maintain, especially when more accurate alternative tests are available. Based on our analysis, we strongly recommend the removal of the H. pylori IgA and IgM serologic tests throughout the DOD in order to improve the efficiency and quality of care for patients suspected of having an H. pylori infection. Further research is needed to determine how these tests are ordered, how providers are responding to the results of the serologic tests, and if noninvasive testing is being ordered appropriately.",2020,"Pak, Kevin; Junga, Zachary; Mertz, Andrew; Singla, Manish",Mil. med,,#32633752,,,,,220387903.0

This is a very important issue, because one way to have more control over seasonal outbreaks is to understand the factors that underlie them. In this paper, I will evaluate the relevance of the microbiome as one of such factors. The paper is based on two pillars of reasoning. Firstly, on the idea that microbiomes play an important role in their hosts' defence against infectious diseases. Secondly, on the idea that microbiomes are not stable, but change seasonally. These two ideas are combined in order to argue that seasonal changes in a given microbiome may influence the functionality of the host's immune system and consequently make it easier for infectious agents to infect the host at certain times of year. I will argue that, while this is only a theoretical possibility, certain studies may back up such claims. Furthermore, I will show that this does not necessarily contradict other hypotheses aimed at explaining seasonal outbreaks; in fact, it may even enhance them.",2020-11-09,"Stencel, Adrian","BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology",,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.202000148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33165975/,226284166.0

We characterized the variability in the acute illness experience and ongoing recovery process from participants in a COVID-19 recovery cohort study in Northern California in 2020. METHOD: We completed 24 semi-structured in-depth interviews with adults with confirmed positive SARV-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test result, had recovered or were recovering from acute infection, and underwent serial evaluations. We purposefully sampled English- and Spanish-speaking adults with asymptomatic, mild, and severe symptomatic infection, including those who were hospitalized and those with HIV co-infection. We used a thematic analysis to analyze interviews and identify salient themes. RESULTS: After integrating the thematic analysis with clinical data, we identified key themes: (1) across symptom profiles and severity, experiencing COVID-19 was associated with psychological distress; (2) symptomatic infection carried uncertainty in symptom presentation and ongoing recovery (e.g., long COVID); and (3) health information-seeking behavior was facilitated by access to medical care and uncertainty with the recovery process.

However, little is known about the socio-emotional impact of these closures on young children. This paper draws upon a study of 506 parents of children aged 1-10 years in Ireland who completed the online Play and Learning in the Early Years (PLEY) Survey during lockdown in May and June 2020. Parents responded to a series of questions about their child's play, learning and development during lockdown, and described the impact of the restrictions on their children's lives. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. Findings indicate that most children missed their friends, playing with other children, and the routine and structure of ECEC and school settings. Parents described the negative impact of the closure of these settings on their children's social and emotional well-being, which they suggested, resulted in tantrums, anxiety, clinginess, boredom, and under-stimulation. However, some parents did report positive aspects of lockdown for their children and the family, including more time to play with siblings and a break from the usual routine. While the findings of the PLEY study indicate that children's socio-emotional development was severely disrupted during lockdown, with a variety of negative impacts, this experience was not universal. Moreover, the findings suggest that families missed the nurturing environment provided by ECEC programs that supported their children's socio-emotional development, as well as the structure and routine afforded by their children's participation in early childhood programs.",2021,"Egan, Suzanne M; Pope, Jennifer; Moloney, Mary; Hoyne, Clara; Beatty, Chloé",Early Child Educ J,,#covidwho-1206904,,,,,233423732.0

A multitude of immunological changes characterizes pregnancy to create the optimal milieu for the unborn child. Both these immunological changes and pre-conceptional, sub-optimal disease control may affect the severity of the respective allergic disease manifestations during pregnancy and pose a risk for mother and child. Due to apparent limitations in conducting clinical trials, safety data on anti-allergic drugs during pregnancy are limited. This lack of clinical evidence demands to counsel between potential and known risks and benefits of anti-allergic drugs. This includes the potential of disease aggravation in the absence of treatment. By doing so, informed decisions and shared decision-making is facilitated. In particular, in patients with severe asthma, education about the risk of uncontrolled asthma for mother and child should be part of regular care.

bxe5fo0s,,WHO,Assessing the impact of inflammatory markers and CT severity score on disease severity of COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU at a tertiary hospital,,,,unk,"Background: In December 2019, SARS-COV-2 infection emerged in Wuhan, China causing COVID-19 and subsequently spread throughout the globe. A great uncertainty is associated with the disease progression, as the risk of severe COVID-19 is not uniform among all the patients. Systemic inflammation has been reported as a predictor for COVID-19 outcomes. Elevated levels of inflammatory markers are shown to be associated with endothelial dysfunction, cytokine storm and coagulopathy in COVID-19. There is a growing body of evidence, that these findings exert influence in the causation of mortality in patients with severe Covid-19. The present study is carried out with an aim to evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients by interrelating their clinical severity with inflammatory markers and CT (Computed tomography) severity score (CTSS). Objectives: The aim of the study is to correlate COVID-19 severity with inflammatory markers and CT severity score. We also aim to determine the optimal cut-off values for inflammatory markers and CT severity scores in order to establish their interrelationship to the disease severity. Materials and Methods: It is a hospital-based retrospective observational study. The study was conducted over a period of four months (July 2020 to October 2020) based on data obtained from the records of patients, admitted with a laboratory confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection. The current study included a total of 84 patients, admitted to ICU with the severe COVID-19.Study tools included serum CRP, serum ferritin, D-dimer, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and 25-point CT severity score obtained from HRCT (high resolution computerized tomography) chest. Results: Out of 84 patients recruited, 54 patients were survivors and 30 patients were non-survivors (deceased). 78% of the study population was male and 22% was female. For survivors, average CTSS was 12.43 ± 5.7 and whereas average CTSS for non-survivors was 18.87 ± 4.68(p&lt;0001). Average D-dimer was 2.5 ± 1.43 in the survivor group and 3.39 ± 0.95 for non-survivors (p&lt;0.004). Correlation coefficient of CTSS with FiO2 is 0.685 (p&lt;0.0001). The optimal cut-off value for predicting mortality for D-dimer is &gt;2.4 (p&lt;0.0012) and for CTSS is &gt;15 (p&lt;0.0001). Conclusion: The disease severity was significantly correlated with CTSS and D- dimer. Severe COVID-19 was also associated with a high NLR (neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio) and moderately elevated inflammatory markers (CRP, Ferritin, IL-6). CTSS &gt;15 and D-dimer &gt;2.4 correlate strongly with mortality. CTSS has the greatest diagnostic accuracy for stratifying the disease severity and predicting the mortality among the markers/ characteristics compared. © 2021 Journal of Association of Physicians of India.

DESIGN: A qualitative phenomenological design was used. METHODS: We enrolled 15 nurses who provided care for patients infected by COVID-19 purposively and through snowballing, using a phenomenological approach in critical care units of Iran's public hospitals between May and June 2020. The semi-structured interviews were carried out either via face-to-face or telephone and were analyzed using the 7-step method of Colaizzi. RESULTS: The experiences of nurses caring for patients infected with COVID-19 were categorized into four challenges, including psychological (eight subthemes), organizational (six subthemes), social (six subthemes), and professional (five subthemes). In general, based on the current classification, there seems to be a mixture of positive and negative effects on the psychological, social, and professional challenges and the negative effect only on the organizational challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Positive and negative emotions and experiences have coexisted for the critical care nurses since the COVID-19 outbreak. Emotional support and psychological counseling play an important role in maintaining nurses' optimal mental health during the COVID-19 crisis. Adequate protective equipment, financial and nonfinancial supports, effective communication, training and hiring of staff, and appropriate work shifts are also required to reduce nurses' negative experiences when providing care for the affected individuals.",2021,"Chegini, Zahra; Arab-Zozani, Morteza; Rajabi, Mohammad Reza; Kakemam, Edris",Nurs. forum,,#covidwho-1199709,,,,,233400688.0

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the ongoing pandemic has changed people's habits related to skincare products and cosmetic procedures. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter survey study covering both private and public hospitals. Sociodemographic characteristics and clinical diagnoses of the patients were noted by dermatologists. A survey was used to determine the type and application areas of skincare products and cosmetic procedures before and during the pandemic, whether the patients were concerned about being infected, and any change in the make‐up habits of female patients. RESULTS: Of the 1437 patients, 86.7% presented to the hospital due to dermatological complaints and 13.3% for cosmetic procedures. The rate of those that did not use skincare products was 0.05% before and 0.06% during the pandemic. Of the participants, 43.2% had undergone cosmetic procedures before and 38.1% during the pandemic. For both periods, the most frequent cosmetic procedure applied was laser epilation, followed by skincare treatment and chemical peeling.

However severity of disease varies considerably and understanding physiological changes that may link to poor outcomes is important. Although increased serum ferritin has been observed in COVID-19 patients consistent with inflammation, other iron parameters have not been examined to our knowledge. Because iron is required for immunity and oxygen utilisation, and dysregulated iron homeostasis has been observed in COPD, we investigated serum iron concentrations in 30 patients with COVID-19 requiring ICU admission. All patients had low serum iron but patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure had more profound hypoferraemia. The area under the curve for receiver operating characteristic curves for serum iron to identify severe hypoxemia was 0.95; the optimal Youden Index for distinguishing between severe and non-severe hypoxemia was a serum iron concentration of 2.9 micromol/L. By linear regression, serum iron was associated with lymphocyte count and PaO2/FiO2. In conclusion, profound hypoferraemia identifies COVID-19 patients with severe hypoxaemia. Serum iron is a simple biomarker that could be usefully employed to stratify patients and monitor disease.

As the numbers are increasing, the critical care demand is also increasing. Tracheostomy is one of the commonest procedures which has been performed on COVID positive ventilated patients. It is important to understand and follow the utmost safe practices for the patient and the health care workers for such aerosol generating procedures. The aim of this study is to identify the lacunae in tracheostomy practices during this COVID times and suggest a systematic approach for the safe practices. An online questionnaire survey-based study was performed in September 2020. The target population was practicing otolaryngologists of India with various years of experience. The aim of the study was to evaluate the lacunae in tracheostomy safe practices and to create a systematic approach for the safety of health care workers. Data compilation and analysis was done by using Microsoft Excel. A systematic COVID TIDE tracheostomy safe practices approach was designed after reviewing various tracheostomy guidelines and recommendations. Total 114 otolaryngologists responded with a complete survey report. 72.2% responders were not up to date with their knowledge of tracheostomy safe practices. 79.8% were not performing this procedure in a negative pressure room. 15.8% were not aware of the personal protective equipment level they are using. Only 56.1% survey responders were holding the ventilation before tracheal incision. Overall, 94.7% responders were keen to know about the safe approach of tracheostomy in COVID positive patients. Tracheostomy is an aerosol generating procedure, lacunae in the knowledge can cause major risk to health care professionals. Finally, in such crises, consideration should be taken for simulation exercises, dedicated airway teams and a systematic COVID TIDE approach to improve the safety of the staff and patients.

This study aims to evaluate the direct medical costs of patients with PD using a large sample from an entire city and to identity the potential factors correlating with their inpatient costs in Guangzhou City, Southern China. Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study uses data obtained from the Urban Employee-based Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) and the Urban Resident-based Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) administrative claims databases in Guangzhou City from 2008 to 2012. The total sample was comprised of 2660 patients with PD. Costs were evaluated for the total sample and by types of insurance. The composition of costs was compared between the UEBMI and URBMI subgroups. The extended estimating-equations model was applied to identify the potential impact factors influencing the inpatient costs. Results: The direct medical costs per patient with PD were CNY 14,514.9 (USD 2299.4) in 2012, consisting of inpatient costs of CNY 13,551.4 and outpatient costs of CNY 963.5. The medication costs accounted for the largest part (50.3%). The inpatient costs of PD patients under the UEBMI scheme (CNY 13,651.0) were significantly higher than those of patients in the URBMI subgroup (CNY 12,402.2) (p < 0.05). The proportion of out-of-pocket spending out of inpatient and outpatient costs for UEBMI beneficiaries (24.3% and 56.1%) was much lower than that for patients under the URBMI scheme (47.9% and 76.2%). The regression analysis suggested that types of insurance, age, hospital levels, length of stay (LOS) and comorbidities were significantly correlated with the inpatient costs of patients with PD. Conclusions: The direct medical costs of patients with PD in China were high compared to the GDP per capita in Guangzhou City and different between the two evaluated types of insurance. Patients with the UEBMI scheme, of older age, with comorbidities, staying in tertiary hospitals and with longer LOS had significantly higher inpatient costs. Thus, policymakers need to reduce the gaps between the two urban insurance schemes in benefit levels, provide support for the development of a comprehensive long-term care insurance system and promote the use of telemedicine in China.",2022-03-09,"Zhang, Hui; Zhou, Wenjing; Zhang, Donglan",Int J Environ Res Public Health,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7d31e8497b44db0730b2de96b4077be494138d28.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8953775.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8953775/,

Concerns were raised on scientific quality and generalizability of this emerging evidence. MAIN ARGUMENT: However, this way acting is not entirely new and often public health decisions are based on flawed and ambiguous evidence. Thus, to better guide decisions in these circumstances, in this article we argue that there is a need to follow fundamental principles in order to guide best public health practices. We purpose the usefulness of the framework of principalism in public which has been proved useful in real life conditions as a guide in the absence of reliable evidence.

It included items regarding ethical awareness and standard precaution self-efficacy at the individual level as well as safety environment, organizational culture for infection control, and degree of compliance with standard precautions at the organizational level. Individual and organizational predictors were identified using a multilevel analysis. The results indicated that 81.1% of nurses' compliance with standard precautions was influenced by individual differences, while only 18.9% was influenced by organizational differences. Individual- and organizational-level predictors explained 46.7% and 55.4% of the variance in emergency department nurses' compliance with standard precautions, respectively.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two viruses, FeCoV (Strain Munich; titer 107.5 TCID50/ml) and H1N1 (RE 230/90; titer 106.5 TCID50/ml), were used in this study. Manual toothbrushes were disassembled into bristles, bristle fixation, and back of the toothbrush head, contaminated with the viruses and air-dried for 24 h. In a second experiment, whole toothbrush heads were contaminated, rinsed with water (5 ml for 15 s) and then air-dried. RESULTS: For FeCoV, immediately after contamination, the following average titers were recovered: fixation: 10(6.41), back of head: 10(6.81) and bristles: 10(6.63) TCID(50)/ml. Following air-drying of 12 (fixation) and 24 h, titers of ≤ 10(2.5), 10(3.75), and 10(2.72) TCID(50)/ml were found in the respective groups, with a detection limit of 10(2.5) TCID(50)/ml. For H1N1, immediately after contamination, the following average titers could be recovered: fixation: 10(5.53), back of head: 10(5.97) and bristles: 10(5.75) TCID(50)/ml. Following air-drying of 8 (fixation) and 24 h, titers were ≤ 10(2.5), 10(3.63), and 10(3.53) TCID(50)/ml in the respective group, again with 10(2.5) TCID(50)/ml being the detection limit.

Using this information as well as user inputs, the model estimates a time series of demand for intensive care beds and acute care beds as well as the availability of those beds. The online model is designed to be intuitive and interactive so that local leaders with limited technical or epidemiological expertise may make decisions based on a variety of scenarios. This complements high-level models designed for public consumption and technically sophisticated models designed for use by epidemiologists.

However, despite several articles published on AIDs and its assessment by monocytic HLA-DR monitoring, several missing informations remained: 1—Which patients’ are more prone to benefit from mHLA-DR measurement, 2—Is the nadir or the duration of the low mHLA-DR expression the main parameter to consider? 3—What are the compared performances of leukocytes’ count analyses (lymphocyte, monocyte). MATERIAL AND METHOD: We conducted an observational study in a surgical ICU of a French tertiary hospital. A first mHLA-DR measurement (fixed flow cytometry protocol) was performed within the first 3 days following admission and a 2nd, between day 5 and 10. The other collected parameters were: SAPS II and SOFA scores, sex, age, comorbidities, mortality and ICU-acquired infections (IAI). The associations between mHLA-DR and outcomes were tested by adjusted Fine and Gray subdistribution competing risk models. RESULTS: 1053 patients were included in the study, of whom 592 had a 2nd mHLA-DR measurement. In this cohort, 223 patients (37.7%) complicated by IAI. The initial decrement in mHLA-DR was not associated with the later occurrence of IAI, (p = 0.721), however, the persistence of a low mHLA-DR (< 8000 AB/C), measured between day 5 and day 7, was associated with the later occurrence of IAI (p = 0.01). Similarly, a negative slope between the first and the second value was significantly associated with subsequent IAI (p = 0.009). The best performance of selected markers was obtained with the combination of the second mHLA-DR measurement with SAPSII on admission. Persisting lymphopenia and monocytopenia were not associated with later occurrence of IAI. CONCLUSION: Downregulation of mHLA-DR following admission is observed in a vast number of patients whatever the initial motif for admission. IAI mostly occurs among patients with a high severity score on admission suggesting that immune monitoring should be reserved to the most severe patients. The initial downregulation did not preclude the later development of IAI. A decreasing or a persisting low mHLA-DR expression below 8000AB/C within the first 7 days of ICU admission was independently and reliably associated with subsequent IAI among ICU patients with performances superior to leukocyte subsets count alone.

Modeling of such diseases can be extremely important in the prediction of their impact. While classic, statistical, modeling can provide satisfactory models, it can also fail to comprehend the intricacies contained within the data. In this paper, authors use a publicly available dataset, containing information on infected, recovered, and deceased patients in 406 locations over 51 days (22nd January 2020 to 12th March 2020). This dataset, intended to be a time-series dataset, is transformed into a regression dataset and used in training a multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN). The aim of training is to achieve a worldwide model of the maximal number of patients across all locations in each time unit. Hyperparameters of the MLP are varied using a grid search algorithm, with a total of 5376 hyperparameter combinations. Using those combinations, a total of 48384 ANNs are trained (16128 for each patient group-deceased, recovered, and infected), and each model is evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2). Cross-validation is performed using K-fold algorithm with 5-folds. Best models achieved consists of 4 hidden layers with 4 neurons in each of those layers, and use a ReLU activation function, with R2 scores of 0.98599 for confirmed, 0.99429 for deceased, and 0.97941 for recovered patient models.

Only participants who indicated awareness of peer workers were asked about helpfulness. Seventy-five participants (9.2%) reported accessing a peer worker, but over half the sample were not aware they existed (n = 448). Mean helpfulness ratings indicated that participants believed peer work is somewhat or very helpful. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, age was associated with both greater awareness and perceived helpfulness;awareness was also associated with social impairment, and helpfulness with positive social support.

Applying the same technique to aspherical or inhomogeneous particles yields the position, diameter and refractive index of an effective sphere that represents an average over the particle's geometry and composition. This effective-sphere interpretation has been applied successfully to porous, dimpled and coated spheres, as well as to fractal clusters of nanoparticles, all of whose inhomogeneities appear on length scales smaller than the wavelength of light. Here, we combine numerical and experimental studies to investigate effective-sphere characterization of symmetric dimers of micrometer-scale spheres, a class of aspherical objects that appear commonly in real-world dispersions. Our studies demonstrate that the effective-sphere interpretation usefully identifies dimers in holographic characterization studies of monodisperse colloidal spheres. The effective-sphere estimate for a dimer's axial position closely follows the ground truth for its center of mass. Trends in the effective-sphere diameter and refractive index, furthermore, can be used to measure a dimer's three-dimensional orientation.

However, our current understanding of the mechanisms that nanoparticles can influence immune responses is still limited, and systemic clinical trials are necessary for the evaluation of their security and long-term effects. This review provides an overview of the recent advances in nanoparticles that can interact with different cellular and molecular components of the immune system and their application in the management of inflammatory diseases, which are caused by abnormal immune reactions. This article focuses on the mechanisms of interaction between nanoparticles and the immune system and tries to provide a reference for the future design of nanotechnology for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of miR-146a on RSV replication and the related mechanisms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We pretreated A549 and HEp-2 cells and young rats with miR-146a mimic before infection with RSV. The expressions of miR-146a and RSV-F mRNA in cells and lung tissues were detected by RT-qPCR, and production of IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-18, and TNF-α in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were determined by ELISA. The expression level of TRAF-6 and activation of the JNK/ERK/MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway was detected by Western blotting. RESULTS: RSV infection significantly reduced miR-146a levels in both A549 and HEp-2 cells and rat lung tissues. RSV infection resulted in accelerated growth, increased release of inflammatory cytokines, increased expression of TRAF-6, and activation of the JNK pathway in cells, and the lung inflammatory infiltration and the pathological score increased in rats. Overexpression of miR-146a targeted down-regulation of TRAF-6 expression and JNK/ERK/MAPK/NF-κB pathway induced by RSV infection, reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines IL-1ß, IL-6 and TNF-α, and alleviate lung injury in young rats.

However, it is unknown how vaccinated people perceive the effectiveness of COVID-19 and how their subjective well-being and mental health change after vaccination. We thus observed the same individuals on a monthly basis from March 2020 to September 2021 in all parts of Japan. Then, large sample panel data (N=54,007) were independently constructed. Using the data, we compared the individuals perceptions of COVID-19, subjective well-being, and mental health before and after vaccination. Furthermore, we compared the effect of vaccination on the perceptions of COVID-19 and mental health for females and males. We used the fixed-effects model to control for individual time-invariant characteristics. The major findings were as follows: First, the vaccinated people perceived the probability of getting infected and the seriousness of COVID-19 to be lower than before vaccination. This was observed not only when we used the whole sample, but also when we used sub-samples. Second, using the whole sample, subjective well-being and mental health improved.

This is increasingly relevant in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, particularly since the introduction of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio). This invasive species now occupies up to 90% of fish biomass, with hugely detrimental impacts on native fauna and flora. To address the ongoing impacts of carp, cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) has been proposed as a potentially effective biological control. Crucially, however, it is unknown whether CyHV-3 and other cyprinid herpesviruses already exist in the Murray-Darling. Further, little is known about those viruses that naturally occur in wild freshwater fauna, and the frequency with which these viruses jump species boundaries. To document the evolution and diversity of freshwater fish viromes and better understand the ecological context to the proposed introduction of CyHV-3, we performed a meta-transcriptomic viral survey of invasive and native fish across the Murray-Darling Basin, covering over 2,200 km of the river system. Across a total of 36 RNA libraries representing 10 species, we failed to detect CyHV-3 nor any closely related viruses. Rather, meta-transcriptomic analysis identified 18 vertebrate-associated viruses that could be assigned to the Arenaviridae, Astroviridae, Bornaviridae, Caliciviridae, Coronaviridae, Chuviridae, Flaviviridae, Hantaviridae, Hepeviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Picornaviridae, Poxviridae, Reoviridae and Rhabdoviridae families, and a further 27 that were deemed to be associated with non-vertebrate hosts. Notably, we revealed a marked lack of viruses that are shared among invasive and native fishes sampled here, suggesting that there is little virus transmission from common carp to native fish species. Overall, this study provides the first data on the viruses naturally circulating in a major river system and supports the notion that fish harbour a large diversity of viruses with often deep evolutionary histories. Author Summary The ongoing invasion of the common carp in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, has wreaked havoc on native freshwater ecosystems. This has stimulated research into the possible biological control of invasive carp through the deliberate release of the virus cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3). However, little is known on the diversity of viruses that naturally circulate in wild freshwater fauna, whether these viruses are transmitted between invasive and native species, nor if CyHV-3 or other cyprinid herpesviruses are already present in the basin. To address these fundamental questions we employed meta-transcriptomic next-generation sequencing to characterise the total assemblage of viruses (i.e. the viromes) in three invasive and seven native fish species cohabiting at 10 sites across 2,200 km of the river system. From this analysis we identified 18 vertebrate-associated viruses across 14 viral families, yet a marked lack of virus transmission between invasive and native species. Importantly, no CyHV-3 was detected. This study shows that freshwater fish harbour a high diversity and abundance of viruses, that viruses have likely been associated with fish for millennia, and that there is likely little direct virus transmission between introduced and native species.",2021-02-25,"Costa, Vincenzo A.; Mifsud, Jonathon C.O.; Gilligan, Dean; Williamson, Jane E.; Holmes, Edward C.; Geoghegan, Jemma L.",bioRxiv,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/cccecda757d3a1d282ed353b12b859915dc6b465.json,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.25.432824,232081778.0

With routine preoperative screening, we are identifying an increasing number of patients with asymptomatic and mild COVID-19. Our objective was to determine the risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality among patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. Methods: A multicenter, retrospective study of patients with asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infection (severity definitions developed by Chinese CDC), diagnosed within 8 days of surgery from March 2020 to February 2021. Primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included pulmonary and thromboembolic complications. Results: Study cohort consisted of 54 patients. Median age was 50y (interquartile range [IQR] 37.5-62.5y), median BMI was 28.8 kg/m2 (IQR 23.5-31.3kg/m2), and 67.3% had no comorbidities. SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected preoperatively in 75%, and 26.7% had lung infiltrates seen on admission imaging. Before admission, 92.3% of patients were asymptomatic, and 7.7% had mild COVID-19 symptoms. Of the procedures, 40.3% were general surgery and 21.2% orthopaedic, the remaining 38.5% were subspecialties. General anesthesia was used in 86.5% of cases and laparoscopy was used in 25%. Overall mortality was 0%. Overall rates of postoperative pulmonary and thromboembolic complications were 9.6% and 1.9%, respectively. New COVID-19 symptoms developed in 19.2% of patients postoperatively. [Formula presented] Conclusion: Postoperative complications and overall mortality appear low in patients with asymptomatic and mild COVID-19 diagnosed in the perioperative period.

With periodic incorporation of updates on standardized protocol and guidelines, we formulated a plan and delivered that in a coordinated manner in educating the clinical and nursing staffs regarding the COVID -19 specimen collection and processing for testing to overcome that. METHODS: We gathered all the communications for COVID -19 from the federal, state and city health authorities and our corporate management about the testing methods, collection and processing requirements and specimen pickups. We verified and customized that information, prepared and circulated them in detailed PowerPoint presentation and then updated that periodically with any addition or changes in the testing reference labs and/or their specimen requirements. RESULTS: With periodic, standardized and updated guidelines and detailed verified information and instructions for sample processing, a uniform and much coordinated specimen collection and processing could be achieved and all of our five-borough spanning multisite municipal ambulatory clinics could collect and process the COVID-19 specimens properly.

There is insufficient evidence from previous studies about the role of several circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in the early development of DN. This study aimed to describe the expression of miRNA-377, miRNA-93, miRNA-25, miRNA-216a, and miRNA-21 in a sample of type 1 diabetic children and adolescents to explore their association with DN and some indices of kidney injury. Patients and Methods Seventy type 1 diabetic patients, with 5 years' duration of diabetes or more, were recruited from Children's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University. Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the expression of the above mentioned miRNAs in serum and to assess its association with DN, and the studied risk factors. Results There was a significantly higher percentage of up-regulation of miRNA-377 and miRNA-93 (P=0.03, 0.02, respectively) in addition to significant down-regulation of miRNA-25 (P=0.01) in patients with DN than in patients without DN. In patients with DN, expression of miR-216a was significantly negatively correlated with creatinine (r=-0.4, P=0.04) and positively correlated with eGFR using creatinine (r=0.5, P=0.03). In the same group, expression of miR-21 was positively correlated with urinary cystatin C (r=0.6, P=0.01) and was negatively correlated with e-GFR using cystatin c (r=-0.6, P=0.01). miRNA-93 was associated with increased risk (odds ratio=15, 95% CI=12.03-24.63, P=0.01), while miRNA-25 was associated with decreased risk for albuminuria (odds ratio=0.15, 95% CI=0.08-0.55, P=0.03). Conclusion miRNA-377, miRNA-93, miRNA-216a, and miRNA-21 may be implicated in the pathogenesis of DN, while miRNA-25 may have a reno-protective role.

However, there is little understanding of the effects of tissue edema on antiviral effector mechanisms. In as much as defects in IFN-α function (such as due to presence of autoantibodies) are now implicated in enhanced severity of covid-19 disease, we investigated how hypoosmolarity and cellular edema might affect the antiviral activity of IFN-α-induced human MxA GTPase, a major antiviral effector against several RNA and DNA viruses. We had previously discovered that cytoplasmic human MxA existed in the cytoplasm in phase-separated membraneless biomolecular condensates with a gel-like internal consistency. The vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) nucleocapsid (N) protein associated with such MxA condensates in cells exhibiting an antiviral phenotype. Unexpectedly, MxA condensates displayed rapid and reversible osmosensing properties. Condensates of both IFN-α-induced endogenous MxA and of exogenous GFP-MxA expressed in human A549 lung and Huh7 hepatoma cells rapidly disassembled within 1-2 min when cells were exposed to hypotonic buffer (approx. 50 mOsm), and rapidly reassembled into new structures within 1-2 min of shifting of cells to isotonic culture medium (approx. 330 mOsm). GFP-MxA condensates in cells continuously exposed to culture medium in the range one-fourth, one-third or one-half isotonicity first rapidly disassembled within 1-2 min, and then, in most cells. spontaneously reassembled 7-15 min later into new structures. The data are consistent with cytoplasmic ""crowding"" as the mechanism driving MxA condensate formation. In terms of antiviral function, one 5 min cycle of disassembly and reassembly of GFP-MxA condensates at 1 or 2 hr after VSV infection did not affect MxA antiviral activity. Additionally, continuous exposure of GFP-MxA expressing A549 lung cells to culture medium at one-fourth or one-third tonicity (thus triggering a cycle of disassembly and slower spontaneous reassembly in the continued presence of hypotonic culture medium) together with a VSV challenge, left antiviral activity largely unaffected. Such cultures showed an increase in number of cells with VSV N colocalized with the reassembled GFP-MxA condensates. The data reveal a novel property of MxA biomolecular condensates - rapid and reversible osmosensing.

Seven coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS, MERS and, COVID-19) can naturally infect human beings. Out of these four (229E-CoV, NL63-CoV, OC43-CoV, HKU1-CoV) are responsible for mild upper respiratory infections, while SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and COVID-19 are well known for their high mortality. Few mild strains of coronaviruses are circulating in India but there is no evidence of SARS and MERS outbreaks. The COVID-19 is an emerging viral infection responsible for pandemics. Fortunately, the mortality of COVID-19 is low as compared with SARS and MERS, the majority of its cases are recovered. The death toll of COVID-19 is high even after its low mortality because COVID-19 causes a pandemic while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause epidemics only.

Epidemiological and clinical data were collected using online patient-reported outcome questionnaires. Patients benefited from objective olfactory evaluation (Sniffin-Sticks-test) and were invited to attend for repeated evaluation until scores returned to normal levels. Results: From March 22 to May 22, 2020, 88 patients with sudden-onset LOS completed the evaluations. LOS developed after general symptoms in 44.6% of cases. Regarding objective evaluation, 22 patients (25.0%) recovered olfaction within 14 days following the onset of LOS. The smell function recovered between the 16th and the 70th day post-LOS in 48 patients (54.5%). At the time of final assessment at 2 months, 20.5% of patients (N = 18) had not achieved normal levels of olfactory function. Higher baseline severity of olfactory loss measured using Sniffin-Sticks was strongly predictive of persistent loss (p < 0.001). Conclusion: In the first 2 months, 79.5% of patients may expect to have complete recovery of their olfactory function. The severity of olfactory loss, as detected at the first Sniffin-Sticks-test, may predict the lack of mid-term recovery.",2020-11-24,"Lechien, Jerome R.; Journe, Fabrice; Hans, Stephane; Chiesa-Estomba, Carlos M.; Mustin, Vincent; Beckers, Eline; Vaira, Luigi A.; De Riu, Giacomo; Hopkins, Claire; Saussez, Sven",Front Med (Lausanne),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/b414ff81696a941e18e2def7ca45045ce72ca64c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7732577.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33330539/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.582802,227128205.0

On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. Since then, frontline healthcare professionals have been experiencing extremely stressful situations and damage to their physical and mental health. These adverse conditions cause stress and biochemical, hematological, and inflammatory changes, as well as oxidative damage, and could be potentially detrimental to the health of the individual. The study population consisted of frontline health professionals working in BHU in a city in southern Brazil. Among the 45 participants, two were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and were diagnosed using immunochromatographic tests such as salivary RT-LAMP and qRT-PCR. We also evaluated biochemical, hematological, inflammatory, and oxidative stress markers in the participants. The infected professionals (CoV-2-Prof) showed a significant increase in the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), cholesterol, lactic dehydrogenase, lymphocytes, and monocytes. In this group, the levels of uric acid, triglycerides, leukocytes, neutrophils, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets decreased. In the group of uninfected professionals (NoCoV-2-Prof), significant increase in HDL levels and the percentages of eosinophils and monocytes, was observed. Further, in this group, uric acid, LDH, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels, and the hematocrit count and mean corpuscular volume were significantly reduced. Both groups showed significant inflammatory activity with changes in the levels of C-reactive protein and mucoprotein. The NoCoV-2-Prof group showed significantly elevated plasma cortisol levels.

Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is established in many clinical laboratories due its high specificity and sensitivity, making it a logical alternative methodology. However, matching the sensitivity of quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) remains challenging, which forced utilization of antibody-based enrichment prior to targeted LC-MS/MS analysis. When utilizing antibody purification techniques, investigators must decide whether to enrich the target protein or peptides, but there are few studies comparing the two approaches to assist in this decision-making process. In this work, we present a comparison of intact protein and peptide antibody-based purification for LC-MS/MS based detection of SARS-CoV-2. We have found that protein purification yields more intense LC-MS/MS signals, but is also less specific, yielding higher noise and more background when compared to peptide purification techniques. Therefore, when using traditional data analysis techniques, the enrichment technique that provides superior sensitivity varies for individual peptides and no definitive overall conclusion can be made. These observations are corroborated when using a novel machine learning approach to determine positive/negative test results, which yielded superior sensitivity when using protein purification, but better specificity and area under the ROC curve when performing peptide purification.",2022-03-31,"Maus, Anthony; Renuse, Santosh; Kemp, Jennifer; Moehnke, Kayla; Mangalaparthi, Kiran K.; Chavan, Sandip; Madugundu, Anil K.; Vanderboom, Patrick M.; Dasari, Surendra; Kipp, Benjamin R.; Singh, Ravinder J.; Grebe, Stefan K.; Pandey, Akhilesh",Advances in Sample Preparation,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/327cbdc2b857f89e23ba0a3d7f50a7146fc05694.json,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2772582022000158; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772582022000158,248814967.0

Global research on COVID-19 went ‘viral’ with a record 3487 research contributions comprising of 2062 journal papers and 1425 preprints published within the first three months following the outbreak of COVID-19. Surprisingly, the silence of the African research community has been unprecedented – contributing a paltry 0.6% (22 contributions), a figure nearly matched by Colombia (18 publications). Until now, a comprehensive perspective on the reasons for this subdued research response, and COVID-19 themes critical to Africa has been missing. We posit that while a milieu of factors accounts for this silence, unprecedented research opportunities exist to support COVID-19 decision and policy formulation in Africa. The subdued response reflects weak research systems, characterized by deep-rooted challenges, including severe lack of research expertise, funding, and infrastructure, coupled with poor working conditions. Hence, Africa's contribution to research on infectious diseases, including COVID-19, remains weak. Perceptions and attitudes among researchers and policy-makers on COVID-19, and the role of science in decision and policy-making also exist. Moreover, COVID-19 and earlier severe acute respiratory syndromes are considered as ‘imported diseases’ originating from outside Africa. Thus, notions may exist that the control methods will come from outside Africa through ‘technology-transfer’ or ‘capacity-building’. Yet local COVID-19 research is needed to address knowledge gaps, including; (1) potential novel transmission of SARS-CoV-2, (2) adaption of generic COVID-19 control measures to suit African settings, (3) occurrence and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in solid waste, wastewaters, on-site sanitation systems, and drinking water, and (4) the ‘human factor’ including the role of gender, perceptions, myths, attitudes, and religious beliefs in the transmission and control of COVID-19. Therefore, there is a need to: (1) strengthen local research capacity and evaluation systems, (2) consider biosafety and ethical issues, (3) initiate cross-disciplinary research and global collaboration on COVID-19, and (4) integrate science communication in COVID-19 programs.",2020-12-26,"Gwenzi, Willis; Rzymski, Piotr",Environ Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/d8c7bd700f02af416c7f9aca69e3f486652eb34c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7837055.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120315346; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33373609/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935120315346; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110637,229722723.0

Current approaches are driven by practical considerations (e.g. first available virus isolate) rather than a detailed analysis of the characteristics of the virus strain chosen, which can lead to animal models that are not representative of the circulating or emerging clusters. Here, we suggest a combination of epidemiological, experimental and bioinformatic considerations when choosing virus strains for animal model generation. We discuss the currently chosen SARS-CoV-2 strains for international coronavirus disease (COVID-19) models in the context of their phylogeny as well as in a novel alignment-free bioinformatic approach. Unlike phylogenetic trees, which focus on individual shared mutations, this new approach assesses genome-wide co-developing functionalities and hence offers a more fluid view of the 'cloud of variances' that RNA viruses are prone to accumulate. This joint approach concludes that while the current animal models cover the existing viral strains adequately, there is substantial evolutionary activity that is likely not considered by the current models.

wbype8v1,,WHO,Estimating the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 with imperfect serological tests: Exploiting cutoff-free approaches,,,,unk,"Large-scale serological testing in the population is essential to determine the true extent of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Serological tests measure antibody responses against pathogens and use predefined cutoff levels that dichotomize the quantitative test measures into sero-positives and negatives and use this as a proxy for past infection. With the imperfect assays that are currently available to test for past SARS-CoV-2 infection, the fraction of seropositive individuals in serosurveys is a biased estimator of the cumulative incidence and is usually corrected to account for the sensitivity and specificity. Here we use an inference method-referred to as mixture-model approach-for the estimation of the cumulative incidence that does not require to define cutoffs by integrating the quantitative test measures directly into the statistical inference procedure. We confirm that the mixture model outperforms the methods based on cutoffs, leading to less bias and error in estimates of the cumulative incidence. We illustrate how the mixture model can be used to optimize the design of serosurveys with imperfect serological tests. We also provide guidance on the number of control and case sera that are required to quantify the test's ambiguity sufficiently to enable the reliable estimation of the cumulative incidence. Lastly, we show how this approach can be used to estimate the cumulative incidence of classes of infections with an unknown distribution of quantitative test measures. This is a very promising application of the mixture-model approach that could identify the elusive fraction of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. An R-package implementing the inference methods used in this paper is provided. Our study advocates using serological tests without cutoffs, especially if they are used to determine parameters characterizing populations rather than individuals. This approach circumvents some of the shortcomings of cutoff-based methods at exactly the low cumulative incidence levels and test accuracies that we are currently facing in SARS-CoV-2 serosurveys.",2021,"Bouman, Judith A; Riou, Julien; Bonhoeffer, Sebastian; Regoes, Roland R",PLoS Comput Biol,,#1105790,,,,,218530504.0

Much research has focused on illuminant estimation for CCC on single images, with few attempts of leveraging the temporal information intrinsic in sequences of correlated images (e.g., the frames in a video), a task known as Temporal Colour Constancy (TCC). The state-of-the-art for TCC is TCCNet, a deep-learning architecture that uses a ConvLSTM for aggregating the encodings produced by CNN submodules for each image in a sequence. We extend this architecture with different models obtained by (i) substituting the TCCNet submodules with C4, the state-of-the-art method for CCC targeting images; (ii) adding a cascading strategy to perform an iterative improvement of the estimate of the illuminant. We tested our models on the recently released TCC benchmark and achieved results that surpass the state-of-the-art. Analyzing the impact of the number of frames involved in illuminant estimation on performance, we show that it is possible to reduce inference time by training the models on few selected frames from the sequences while retaining comparable accuracy.",2021-06-15,"Rizzo, Matteo; Conati, Cristina; Jang, Daesik; Hu, Hui",,,,2106.07955,document_parses/pdf_json/2d56e1c4172d2620a6eed086974245ff8398b2b5.json,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.07955v1.pdf,235435849.0

Electronic financial transactions are gradually taking over traditional banking services in terms of transferring funds, utility payments, insurance premium, mortgages and even stock trading. Despite the widespread popularity of smartphones and the advantages of mobile banking, the adoption rates of the mobile apps have been very low all over the world. Our study explored the consumer acceptance of mobile apps in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) by using a structured online questionnaire that was designed using standard variables from the Technology Acceptance Model. Principal component analysis was used to identify and score these factors for the subsequent categorical regression analysis. Consumers were assigned numerical categories depending on their level of usage of the app, and the CATREG nonlinear technique was used to determine the significance of technology acceptance factors. The results show that almost two-thirds of the sample were currently using Mobile Banking apps, and they predominantly belonged to the 30–40 age-group. Perceived usefulness and available information were identified as the main factors influencing acceptance and level of usage of mobile banking apps.

Regret could lead to physical and mental morbidity and questions the appropriateness of these procedures in selected patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of regret in transgender individuals who underwent GAS and evaluate associated factors. Methods A systematic review of several databases was conducted. Random-effects meta-analysis, meta-regression, and subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. Results A total of 27 studies, pooling 7928 transgender patients who underwent any type of GAS, were included. The pooled prevalence of regret after GAS was 1% (95% CI <1%-2%). Overall, 33% underwent transmasculine procedures and 67% transfemenine procedures. The prevalence of regret among patients undergoing transmasculine and transfemenine surgeries was <1% (IC <1%-<1%) and 1% (CI <1%-2%), respectively. A total of 77 patients regretted having had GAS. Twenty-eight had minor and 34 had major regret based on Pfäfflin's regret classification. The majority had clear regret based on Kuiper and Cohen-Kettenis classification. Conclusions Based on this review, there is an extremely low prevalence of regret in transgender patients after GAS. We believe this study corroborates the improvements made in regard to selection criteria for GAS. However, there is high subjectivity in the assessment of regret and lack of standardized questionnaires, which highlight the importance of developing validated questionnaires in this population.",2021-03-01,"Bustos, Valeria P; Bustos, Samyd S; Mascaro, Andres; Del Corral, Gabriel; Forte, Antonio J; Ciudad, Pedro; Kim, Esther A; Langstein, Howard N; Manrique, Oscar J",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

Gender has been shown to impact the presentation and progression of AUD; yet, little work has been done to parse the different mechanisms underlying AUD within the lens of gender differences. A review of the literature on adolescence revealed that psychosocial factors, in particular lack of family social support and interactions with peers, drive the onset of alcohol use more strongly in girls relative to boys. However, research done on gender differences in disease progression in adults remains limited. Our gender-specific analysis of the mechanisms underlying AUD in adults revealed that lack of social support was causally linked to negative affect, mental health symptoms, and AUD symptom severity in women, but not men. These novel results suggest that psychosocial factors may play a gender-specific role not only in the onset of use in adolescence, but also in the maintenance of addiction in adults. If confirmed, this suggests the need for investigating gender-specific recovery trajectories.

We investigated the applicability of the m24 mAb to detect the activation of γδ T cells in response to different soluble and immobilized stimuli. m24 mAb staining was associated with the expression of cytokines and was detectable as early as 10 min after stimulation, but with different kinetics depending on the nature of the stimulus. Hence, we conclude that this assay is suitable for the detection of functional γδ T cells and allows the assessment of activation more rapidly than alternative methods such as cytokine detection.

Currently, there are no approved treatments for CoronaVirus Disease 19 (COVID-19); however, therapeutic strategies based on the preclinical evidence include supportive measures, such as oxygen supplementation, antiviral, and anticoagulant agents. Despite these treatments, 10% of patients worsen and develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Since the pathogenic mechanism of ARDS is an uncontrolled inflammatory state, we speculate that removing inflammation effectors from blood may contrast tissue injury and improve clinical outcome. In a scenario of dramatic medical emergency, we conducted an observational study on 9 consecutive patients hospitalized in COVID Intensive Care Unit, where 5 of 9 consecutive patients were treated with HP, due to the emergency overload made it impossible to deliver blood purification in the other 4 patients. COVID-19 was diagnosed through the identification of virus sequences by reverse transcription-PCR on respiratory specimens. All patients had severe pneumonia requiring continuous positive airway pressure. HP was started in all patients 6–7 days after hospital admission. The treated patients (T) received 2 consecutive sessions of HP using CytoSorb cartridge. Our results show a better clinical course of T compared to control patients (C), in fact all T except 1 survived, and only 2 of them were intubated, while all C required intubation and died. Lymphocytopenia worsened in C but not in T. C-reactive protein decreased in both patients, but to a greater extent in T. IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α decreased after HP, IL-10 did not change. Respiratory function remained stable and did not worsen in T compared to C.

We started offering Office 365 in 2016 and migrated our university-wide email service to Microsoft 365 Exchange Online in 2018. Due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19, off-campus uses of Microsoft 365 have increased, and concerns about account security arose. We discussed how to deploy Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to protect our users. Microsoft 365 comes with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), and it includes built-in MFA functionality. With the basic Azure AD MFA, individual users can register MFA information anytime but have no control to enable or disable MFA. Tenant administrators need to enable MFA for each account. For a gradual deployment, we want to allow users to enroll in MFA and register information at their convenience. In addition to that, we want to prevent malicious attackers from registering their MFA information if an account should be already compromised. Such control was difficult with the basic Azure AD MFA. Since 2020 our tenant subscribes to Azure AD Premium P2 licenses, which provides Azure AD Conditional Access. Conditional Access enables fine controls of MFA and other user access behavior with security groups. We designed an MFA self-enrolling and configuration system, and implemented it with Microsoft Forms, Power Automate, Conditional Access, and in-house web applications. By design, this system prohibits MFA information registration until user's self-enrollment in MFA, and requests the user to register MFA information upon the next sign-in after the self-enrollment. This is supposed to reduce the possible unauthorized registration of MFA information. We extensively discussed implementation of various measures and preparation of documents to counter users' troubles and complaints. We started deploying MFA in April 2021, but we have not yet fully mandated MFA due to a push back from some executives expressing concern about the adverse effects of enforcing MFA too quickly. © 2022 ACM.",2022,"Kasahara, Y.; Shimayoshi, T.","49th ACM SIGUCCS User Services Annual Conference, SIGUCCS 2022",,#covidwho-1789009,,,,https://doi.org/10.1145/3501292.3511569,247765622.0

Women's health care is often acute and in continual demand, with poor health outcomes seen in women's health in particular in the recent Ebola and Swine flu epidemics. Regrettably, early reports globally and in the UK have shown a rise in the stillbirth rate. We aimed to evaluate the provision of obstetrics and gynaecology services in the UK during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We undertook an interview-based national survey of junior doctors in obstetrics and gynaecology in women’s healthcare units in the National Health Service using the network of the UK Audit and Research Collaborative in Obstetrics and Gynaecology. We sought responses on general training, labour ward care, antenatal and postnatal care, benign gynaecology and gynaecology oncology services. RESULTS: We received responses from 148/155 units (95%) contacted. Most completed speciﬁc training drills for managing obstetric and gynaecological emergencies (89/148, 60.1%) and two-person donning and dofﬁng of personal protective Equipment (PPE) (96/148, 64.9%). The majority of surveyed units implemented COVID-19-speciﬁc protocols (130/148, 87.8%), offered adequate PPE (135/148, 91.2%) and operated dedicated COVID-19 emergency theatres (105/148,70.8%). Most units suspended elective gynaecology services (131/148, 88.5%). The 2-week referral pathway for oncological gynaecology was not affected in half of the units (76/148,51.4%), but half reported a planned reduction in oncology surgery (82/148, 55.4%) DISCUSSION: Women's health care services have responded well to the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, however further planning is required for the long term.",2021-04-08,"Rimmer, Michael P; Al Wattar, Bassel A; Barlow, Catriona; Black, Naomi; Carpenter, Ciara; Conti-Ramsden, Frances; Dalton, John A W; Davies, Rhianna; Davies, Rebecca; Dunlop, Cheryl; Guyett, Elvena; Jamison, Laura; Karavadra, Babu; Kasaven, Lorraine; Lattey, Katherine; Long, Emma; Macmahon, Caroline; Navaratnam, Kate; Nijjar, Simrit; O’Brien, Stephen; Ojukwu, Obi; Parnell, Laura; Raglan, Olivia; Ramcharn, Meera; Riches, Jenny; Stocker, Linden Jane; Wong, Siew Chee; Wyeth, Charlotte; Rimmer, Michael P",BJS Open,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1093/bjsopen/zrab032.138,233455927.0

This study examines factors that influence perceived workforce preparedness at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) during a pandemic. METHODS: The VA Preparedness Survey was a random, anonymous, web-based survey fielded nationwide October to December 2018. Multivariate statistical analyses examined the effects of study relevant factors (sociodemographic, work-related, general health, and household-related characteristics of VA employees) on perceptions of workforce preparedness, including institutional readiness and understanding of individual roles during a pandemic. RESULTS: Four thousand and twenty-six VA employees responded. Overall, 55% were confident in their VA medical facility’s ability to respond; 49% understood their role; and 68% reported their role to be important during a pandemic. After controlling for study-relevant factors, household preparedness, having plans that address the health care needs of family members, and higher self-reported health status were associated with all 3 workforce preparedness variables. Clinical staff (compared to non-clinical staff) were less likely (OR:0.80, 95% CI:0.68-0.94, P < .01) to have confidence in their medical facility’s ability to respond but more likely (OR:1.77, 95% CI:1.49-2.10, P < .001) to believe their role was important. Employees who have been at the VA longer (OR:1.07, 95% CI:1.01-1.14, P < .05) or have experienced a disaster while working at the VA (OR:1.29, 95% CI:1.04-1.59, P < .05) were more likely to understand their role during a pandemic. CONCLUSION: The findings from this study suggest the need for identifying ways to increase VA employees’ confidence in their medical facility’s ability to respond to a pandemic; develop trainings to improve understanding of their different yet critical roles, for both clinical and non-clinical staff, during a pandemic; create different workforce trainings for newly hired employees; and identify ways to improve household preparedness for a pandemic outbreak.",2021-03-24,"Balut, Michelle D.; Der-Martirosian, Claudia; Dobalian, Aram",J Prim Care Community Health,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/29ac7b256d5d96629a8bbf3a73df4b0792b390ab.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8010801.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33759623/; https://doi.org/10.1177/21501327211004738,232337435.0

A generalized estimating equations approach was used to estimate the change in response variables at AC from BC. RESULTS: Compared to BC, the AC period was characterized by a marked reduction in the number of activations for STEMI (29%, 95% CI:18-38, p < .001), number of activations leading to angiography (34%, 95% CI: 12-50, p = .005) and number of activations leading to PPCI (20%, 95% CI: 11-27, p < .001). A decline in STEMI activations drove the reductions in angiography and PPCI volumes. Relative to BC, the D2B times in the AC period increased on average by 20%, 95%CI (-0.2 to 44, p = .05).

This study compares the changes in epidemiology and trauma patient access to emergency imaging and surgery during the pandemic response. METHODS: The population of interest was all trauma patients captured in the hospital's Trauma Registry from March 16(th) ‐September 10(th), 2016‐2020. Regression modelling assessed changes in mechanism and severity of the injury, and mortality during two lockdowns compared with the proceeding four years. Cases were matched with Hospital Administrative databases, to assess median time from admission to emergency CT scan, operating theatre, length of stay, and immediate surgery (OPSTAT). RESULTS: Throughout 2020, the hospital treated 525 COVID‐19 patients. Compared with previous years, there was up to a 34% reduction in major trauma and a 28% reduction in minor trauma admissions during the pandemic (p<0.05). ICU admissions were almost half of predicted. Some of the largest reductions were seen in motor vehicle crashes (49%) and falls (28%) (p<0.05). Time to CT, surgery and immediate surgery (OPSTAT) showed no change and having a suspected COVID‐19 diagnosis did not prolong any of these times except for the length of stay.

An international consensus.,10.1093/bja/aeu301,,25326478,els-covid,"Fluid management during critical illness is a dynamic process that may be conceptualized as occurring in four phases: rescue, optimization, stabilization, and de-escalation (mobilization). The selection and administration of resuscitation fluids is one component of this complex physiological sequence directed at restoring depleted intravascular volume. Presently, the selection of i.v. fluid is usually dictated more by local practice patterns than by evidence. The debate on fluid choice has primarily focused on evaluating outcome differences between 'crystalloids vs colloids'. More recently, however, there is interest in examining outcome differences based on the chloride content of crystalloid solutions. New insights into the conventional Starling model of microvascular fluid exchange may explain that the efficacy of colloids in restoring and maintaining depleted intravascular volume is only moderately better than crystalloids. A number of investigator-initiated, high-quality, randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that modest improvements in short-term physiological endpoints with colloids have not translated into better patient-centred outcomes. In addition, there is substantial evidence that certain types of fluids may independently worsen patient-centred outcomes. These include hydroxyethyl starch and albumin solutions in selected patient populations. There is no evidence to support the use of other colloids. The use of balanced salt solutions in preference to 0.9% saline is supported by the absence of harm in large observational studies. However, there is no compelling randomized trial-based evidence demonstrating improved clinical outcomes with the use of balanced salt solutions compared with 0.9% saline at this time.",2014,"Raghunathan, K; Murray, P T; Beattie, W S; Lobo, D N; Myburgh, J; Sladen, R; Kellum, J A; Mythen, M G; Shaw, A D",British journal of anaesthesia,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aeu301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25326478/,21387946.0

Repurposing FDA approved drugs should be favored since evaluation of safety and efficacy of de-novo drug design are both costly and time consuming. We report that imatinib, an Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, robustly decreases SARS-CoV-2 infection and uncover a mechanism of action. We show that imatinib inhibits the infection of SARS-CoV-2 and its surrogate lentivector pseudotype. In latter, imatinib inhibited both routes of viral entry, endocytosis and membrane-fusion. We utilized a system to quantify in real-time cell–cell membrane fusion mediated by the SARS-CoV-2 surface protein, Spike, and its receptor, hACE2, to demonstrate that imatinib inhibits this process in an Abl1 and Abl2 independent manner. Furthermore, cellular thermal shift assay revealed a direct imatinib-Spike interaction that affects Spike susceptibility to trypsin digest.

In mice, γδ T cells are a large component of the IEL population. In the rat, γδ IELs are reportedly much less common, but technical issues suggest that previous analyses should be interpreted cautiously. The study of IELs in rats has been impeded by isolation procedures that are lengthy and complex, leading to small cell yields. For this reason, it is possible that rat IELs analyzed in previous studies have not been representative of the entire IEL compartment. We report a new method for the isolation of rat IELs that is based on the selective removal of intestinal epithelial cells under conditions that leave the basement membrane undisturbed. The method is rapid and requires neither enzymatic digestion, nor surgical removal of Peyer's patches, nor vigorous mechanical manipulation of the intestine. The yield of rat IELs using this method is 5- to 10-fold greater than that reported for other methods. Morphological and phenotypic analyses demonstrated that the purified cell population is comprised of IELs and is not contaminated with lamina propria or Peyer's patch lymphocytes. Phenotypic analysis revealed five major subsets of IELs based on differential cell surface expression of CD4, CD8, and αβ T cell receptor (TcR). Among the αβTcR(−) cells was a population of γδ T cells present at levels not previously detected. The isolation of IEL sub-populations using this methodology should facilitate studies of the function of these cells in gut immunity.",1999-04-22,"Todd, Derrick; Singh, Amrik J; Greiner, Dale L; Mordes, John P; Rossini, Aldo A; Bortell, Rita",J Immunol Methods,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/51e3ddc1ff3bb3ec9377fc995a12b632799b58b9.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127418.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10357212/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022175999000150; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022175999000150,25909031.0

vp7vmmgt,,WHO,"How COVID-19 Has Globalized: Unknown Origin, Rapid Transmission, and the Immune System Nourishment",,,,unk,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) profoundly influences T-cell immunity. The counts of total T cells and T-cell subsets, especially CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, are decreased in patients with COVID-19. Also, the function of these cells becomes less effective as the expression of immune inhibitory receptors, such as Tim3 and PD-1, increases over time during the disease. Kinetic analyses show that the T-cell profile changes dynamically, so does the COVID-19 stages. As COVID-19 continues to deteriorate and progresses to severe/critical condition, the lymphocyte count steadily decreases. Therefore, the ability of COVID-19 to escape the immune system might lie in its power to profoundly diminish T-cell effective function, which is necessary for the establishment of a robust antiviral immunity. Also, COVID-19 is associated with increased numbers of monocytes and macrophages, and as the disease progresses from a mild form to a severe/critical condition, the macrophage population becomes denser. Monitoring the expression of cytokines associated with macrophage activation, mainly interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10, indicates that the course of COVID-19 consists of two stages and the transition between disease stages occurs by the end of the first week after onset of symptoms. At the initial stage, the immune military recognizes the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as nonself and thus fires macrophages at the lungs against the virus. The first flame can control disease progression effectively. However, a trained immunocompetent system would maintain the fire of macrophages over an extended time. It lies in its immune memory in tissue-resident macrophages, especially alveolar macrophages, making a professionally trained immune system more likely to be feared by COVID-19 than an untrained immune system. In this manner, the trained immunocompetent system commits such a failure that causes the lungs to come down rapidly. The fact that younger age groups, including neonates and children, are less susceptible to COVID-19 than older age groups reflects that the natural affinities of the immune system that has not been trained thoroughly would be standard in combatting against COVID-19 whereas the higher affinities of the trained immune system for rapid activation of immune responses might raise faults - the lungs come down.",2021,"Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Adv Exp Med Biol,,#1222711,,,,,234362435.0

In particular, we look at the encoder self-attention and encoder-decoder attention heads (in a many-to-one NMT model) that are more specific to the translation of a certain language pair than others by (1) employing metrics that quantify some aspects of the attention weights such as""variance""or""confidence"", and (2) systematically ranking the importance of attention heads with respect to translation quality. Experimental results show that surprisingly, the set of most important attention heads are very similar across the language pairs and that it is possible to remove nearly one-third of the less important heads without hurting the translation quality greatly.",2021-05-31,"Kim, Zae Myung; Besacier, Laurent; Nikoulina, Vassilina; Schwab, Didier",,,,2105.14940,document_parses/pdf_json/48558617dc71742c847d20be2ff0546df50e15ce.json,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.14940v1.pdf,235254522.0

A mutational analysis was performed to test the functional importance of the triple helix for −1 frameshifting in vitro. Changing bases in L2 or base pairs in S1 involved in a base triple resulted in a 2- to 5-fold decrease in frameshifting efficiency. Alterations in the length of L2 had adverse effects on frameshifting. The in vitro effects were well reproduced in vivo, although the effect of enlarging L2 was more dramatic in vivo. The putative role of refolding kinetics of frameshifter pseudoknots is discussed. Overall, the data emphasize the role of the triple helix in −1 frameshifting.",2010-07-17,"Olsthoorn, René C.

In fact, owing to the shortage of personal protective equipment, there was always a threat that any of the healthcare professionals would might become the next statistics in the ongoing pandemic. The issues encountered by the nursing professional were not simple and they essentially demand serious consideration to have a better response in the future.

Aspergillus species are the typical etiologic cause of mold pneumonia, with A. fumigatus in most cases, followed by the Mucorales species. Typical populations at risk include hematologic cancer patients on chemotherapy, bone marrow and solid organ transplant patients, and patients on immunosuppressive medications. Invasive lung disease due to molds is challenging to definitively diagnose based on clinical features and imaging findings alone, as these methods are nonspecific. Etiologic laboratory testing is limited to insensitive culture techniques, non-specific and not readily available PCR, and tissue biopsies, which are often difficult to obtain and impact on the clinical fragility of patients. Microbiologic/mycologic analysis has limited sensitivity and may not be sufficiently timely to be actionable. Due to the inadequacy of current diagnostics, clinicians should consider a combination of diagnostic modalities to prevent morbidity in patients with mold pneumonia. Diagnosis of IMIs requires improvement, and the availability of noninvasive methods such as fungal biomarkers, microbial cell-free DNA sequencing, and metabolomics-breath testing could represent a new era of timely diagnosis and early treatment of mold pneumonia.",2021-07-07,"Foppiano Palacios, Carlo; Spichler Moffarah, Anne",Diagnostics (Basel),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7c6a90353eb066427163c64e84d470add0f86e11.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8304515.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11071226; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34359309/,236320350.0

In this work, we investigate the use of a crowdsourcing application and a real-time disease outbreak surveillance system for five diseases; Influenza, Gastroenteritis, Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI), Scabies and Conjunctivitis, that are closely monitored in Mauritius. We also analyze and correlate the collected data with past statistics. A crowdsourcing mobile application known as Disease Outbreak Tracker (DOT) was implemented and made public. A real-time disease surveillance system using the Early Aberration Reporting System algorithm (EARS) for analysis of the collected data was also implemented. The collected data were correlated to historical data for 2017. Data were successfully collected and plotted on a daily basis. The results show that a few cases of Flu and Scabies were reported in some districts. The EARS methods C1, C2 and C3 also depicted spikes above the set threshold on some days. The study covers data collected over a period of one month. Once symptoms data were collected using DOT, probabilistic methods were used to find the disease or diseases that the user was suffering from. The data were further processed to find the extent of the disease outbreak district-wise, per disease.

Gaining an insight into prevalent risk factors and subtypes in ethnic groups may help target prevention efforts. Methods We retrospectively identified patients originally not of Irish ethnicity (ONIE) admitted to the acute stroke unit between 2016 and 2018 through surname recognition (N=44). Country of origin was confirmed on chart review. The presumed native Irish (PNI) patients admitted over the same time frame were used as a comparison group (N=437). Data was collected on stroke subtype, comorbidities, outcomes and socioeconomic factors. Results Patients ONIE made up 9.1% of all stroke unit admissions. Male gender was more common accounting for 33 of 44 (75%) patients ONIE and 251 of 437 (57.4%) PNI (p = 0.02). Overall ONIE were younger than PNI patients (mean age 57.5 [SD 13.0] vs 69.6yr [SD 13.2], p <0.001).

BACKGROUND: We recently reported that the glomerular endothelium expresses toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and TLR4 in diabetic environments and TLR2/4 ligand Porphyromonas (P.) gingivalis lipopolysaccharides (Pg-LPS) induce nephropathy in diabetic mice. It is thought that Pg-LPS promotes the chronic inflammation with the overexpression of leukocyte adhesion molecules and renal-specific metabolic enzymes by the recognition of Pg-LPS via TLR in the diabetic kidneys. There have been no reports of the effects of periodontopathic bacteria on the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules and the accumulation of physiologically active substances in the kidney. METHODS: The immunohistochemical investigation was performed on diabetic mouse kidney with Pg-LPS-induced nephropathy with glomerulosclerosis in glomeruli. RESULTS: There were no vessels which expressed vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), E-selectin, or fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic ICR mice (STZ-ICR), or in healthy ICR mice administered Pg-LPS (LPS-ICR). However, in diabetic ICR mouse kidneys with Pg-LPS-induced nephropathy (LPS-STZ) the expression of VCAM-1 and the accumulation of FGF23 were observed in renal tubules and glomeruli, and the expression of E-selectin was observed in renal parenchyma and glomeruli. The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was detected in the proximal tubules but not in other regions of ICR, STZ-ICR, or LPS-ICR. In LPS-STZ ACE2 was detected both in renal tubules as well as in glomeruli. The Mac-1 and podoplanin-positive cells increased in the renal parenchyma with diabetic condition and there was the distribution of a large number of Mac-1-positive cells in LPS-STZ. CONCLUSIONS: The Pg-LPS may induce diabetic renal inflammation such as glomerulosclerosis and tubulitis with infiltration of Mac-1/podoplanin positive macrophages via glomerular overexpression of VCAM-1 and E-selectin, resulting in accumulation of both ACE2 and FGF23 which were unmetabolized with the inflammation-induced kidney damage under the diabetic condition.

METHODS: We systematically reviewed the literature for ECGs of patients with diLQTS and subsequent TdP. We assessed T-wave morphology in each lead and measured the longest QT interval in the limb and chest leads in a standardized fashion. RESULTS: Of 84 patients, 61.9% were female and mean age was 58.8 years. QTc was significantly longer in chest versus limb leads (mean (standard deviation) 671 (102) vs 655 (97) ms, p=0.02). Using only limb leads for QT interpretation, 18 (21.4%) ECGs were non-interpretable: 10 (11.9%) due to too flat T-waves, 7 (8.3%) due to frequent, early PVCs and 1 (1.2%) due to too low ECG recording quality. In the chest leads, ECGs were non-interpretable in 9 (10.7%) patients: 6 (7.1%) due to frequent, early PVCs, 1 (1.2%) due to insufficient ECG quality, 2 (2.4%) due to missing chest leads but none due to too flat T-waves. The most common T-wave morphologies in the limb leads were flat (51.0%), broad (14.3%) and late peaking (12.6%) T-waves. Corresponding chest lead morphologies were inverted (35.5%), flat (19.6%) and biphasic (15.2%) T-waves. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that QT evaluation by limb leads only underestimates the incidence of diLQTS experiencing TdP and favors the screening using both limb and chest lead ECG.

In the absence of lateral walls, a particle always moves in the direction of the centrifugal force, while its trajectory is deflected in the tangential direction by the inertial Coriolis and Euler forces. Lateral walls, depending on the angle forming with the radial direction, can guide the particle either in the same or in the opposite direction to the centrifugal force, thus resulting in unusual particle trajectories including zig-zag or backwards particle motion. The effect is pronounced in the case of short operation times when the acceleration of the angular rotation, and thus the Euler force, is considerable. The predicted unusual motion is demonstrated by numerically solving the equation of motion in the presence of lateral walls and verified in the experiment with particles of density lower than that of the solvent.

However, while robots can increase efficiency and enable service offerings with reduced human contact, prior research shows a systematic consumer aversion toward service robots relative to human service providers. This potential dilemma raises the managerial question of how firms can overcome consumer aversion and better employ service robots. Drawing on prior research that supports the use of language for building interpersonal relationships, this research examines whether the type of language (social-oriented vs. task-oriented language) a service robot uses can improve consumer responses to and evaluations of the focal service robot, particularly in light of consumers’ COVID-19-related stress. The results show that consumers respond more favorably to a service robot that uses a social-oriented (vs. task-oriented) language style, particularly when these consumers experience relatively higher levels of COVID-19-related stress. These findings contribute to initial empirical evidence in marketing for the efficacy of leveraging robots’ language style to improve customer evaluations of service robots, especially under stressful circumstances. Overall, the results from two experimental studies not only point to actionable managerial implications but also to a new avenue of research on service robots that examines customer-robot interactions through the lens of language and in contexts that can be stressful for consumers (e.g., healthcare or some financial service settings).

The immunogenic response associated with the use of alternative schemes to complete the scheme was not explored. METHODS: We did two non-inferiority randomized clinical trials with outcomes measures blinded to investigators on adults aged 21–65 years, vaccinated with a single dose of rAd26 ≥ 30 days before screening and no history of SARS-CoV-2. Participants were assigned (1:1:1:1:1) to receive either rAd5; ChAdOx1; rAd26; mRNA-1273 or BBIBP-CorV. The primary endpoint was the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentration at 28 days after the second dose, when comparing rAd26/rAd5 with rAd26/ChAdOx1, rAd26/rAd26, rAd26/mRNAmRNA-1273 and rAd26/BBIBP-CorV. Serum neutralizing capacity was evaluated using wild type SARS-CoV-2 reference strain 2019 B.1. The safety outcome was 28-day rate of serious adverse. The primary analysis included all participants who received ≥ 1 dose. The studies were registered with NCT04962906 and NCT05027672. Both trials were conducted in Buenos Aires, Argentina. FINDINGS: Between July 6 and August 3, 2021, 540 individuals (age 56·7 [SD 7·3]; 243 (45%) women) were randomly assigned to received rAd5 (n=150); ChAdOx1 (n=150); rAd26 (N=87); mRNAmRNA-1273 (n=87) or BBIBP-CorV (n=65). 524 participants completed the study. As compared with rAd26/rAd5 (1·00), the GMR (95%CI) at day 28 was 0·65 (0·51–0·84) among those who received ChAdOx1; 0·47 (0·34–0·66) in rAd5; 3·53 (2·68–4·65) in mRNA-1273 and 0·23 (0·16–0·33) in BBIBP-CorV.

METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted with 139 nursing and 147 non-nursing students (N = 286) between August 6 and October 30, 2020. We investigated participants’ general characteristics (that is, sociodemographic and health-promoting behaviors), sensitivity to COVID-19 infection, COVID-19 pandemic response indicators, and psychosocial problems. The factors associated with psychosocial problems were determined using multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Among the COVID-19 pandemic response indicators, perceived health status during the COVID-19 pandemic was verified as a factor associated with psychosocial problems in nursing (β = − 5.831, p < .001) and non-nursing students (β = − 8.513, p < .001). Perceived stress (β = 1.263, p = .045), trust in policy (β = .892, p < .001), and religion (β = − 1.424, p = .004) were verified as correlates of psychosocial problems in non-nursing students. CONCLUSION: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the stakeholders can use our study results to identify students experiencing psychosocial problems and subsequently as a theoretical background for developing intervention programs for those at a high risk of psychosocial problems.

We also evaluated the persistence of the virus on banknotes spiked with SARS-CoV-2 positive diluted human nasopharyngeal samples. Among the 425 banknote samples collected from different entities, 7.29% (n = 31) were tested positive for targeted genes. Twenty-four positive representative samples were assessed for n gene fragments by conventional PCR and sequenced. All the samples that carry viral RNA belonged to the GR clade, the predominantly circulating clade in Bangladesh. In the stability test, the n gene was detected for up to 72 h on banknotes spiked with nasopharyngeal samples, and CT values increase significantly with time (p < 0.05). orf1b gene was observed to be less stable, especially on old banknotes, and usually went beyond detectable limit within 8 to 10 h.

hh142veb,,WHO,Modification of the physicochemical and structural characteristics of zein suspension by dielectric barrier discharge cold plasma treatment,,,,unk,"Owing to the strong hydrophobicity of zein, improved solubility is required to enhance the recovery of bioactive peptides. Using a zein suspension prepared by the antisolvent precipitation method, the impact of varying the voltage during dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) treatment on the physicochemical and conformational properties of zein in water was investigated. Analysis of the particle size, specific surface area, and free sulfhydryl content indicated that the protein solubility was maximized by treatment at 70 V for 70 s. DBD treatment destroyed covalent bonds and introduced some hydrophilic groups onto the zein surface, thus enhancing the contact area with water molecules and leading to a more uniform dispersion. A decrease in the hydrodynamic radius of zein micelles indicated that intermolecular interactions were disrupted, thus improving dispersion stability. A more hydrophilic microenvironment was formed owing to the reduction in hydrophobic interactions. Additionally, evaluation of the secondary structure demonstrated that DBD treatment broke hydrogen bonds, resulting in a loose conformation with more exposed sites of action for water. These results are expected to facilitate the development of technologies for improving utilization of zein. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Strong hydrophobicity limits the application of zein in the food industry. The study indicated that DBD treatment could promote loose structure, and improve dispersion stability and hydrophilicity of zein suspension prepared by antisolvent precipitation method.

An on-line screening registry allowed a daily report of ICU beds occupancy rate by flu infected patients (Flu-OR) admitted in French ICUs. METHODS: We conducted a prospective inception cohort study with results of an on-line screening registry designed for daily assessment of ICU burden. RESULTS: Among the 108 centers participating to the French H1N1 research network on mechanical ventilation (REVA) - French Society of Intensive Care (SRLF) registry, 69 ICUs belonging to seven large geographical areas voluntarily participated in a website screening-registry. The aim was to daily assess the ICU beds occupancy rate by influenza-infected and non-infected patients for at least three weeks. Three hundred ninety-one critically ill infected patients were enrolled in the cohort, representing a subset of 35% of the whole French 2009 pandemic cohort; 73% were mechanically ventilated, 13% required extra corporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and 22% died. The global Flu-OR in these ICUs was only 7.6%, but it exceeded a predefined 15% critical threshold in 32 ICUs for a total of 103 weeks. Flu-ORs were significantly higher in University than in non-University hospitals. The peak ICU burden was poorly predicted by observations obtained at the level of large geographical areas. CONCLUSIONS: The peak Flu-OR during the pandemic significantly exceeded a 15% critical threshold in almost half of the ICUs, with an uneven distribution with time, geographical areas and between University and non-University hospitals.

METHODS Patients treated in MR CLEAN Registry centers with CS or LA as preferred anesthetic approach during EVT for ischemic stroke were analyzed. First, we evaluated the effect of CS on area under the threshold (AUT), relative difference between baseline and lowest procedural mean arterial pressure (∆LMAP) and procedural blood pressure trend, compared to LA. Second, we assessed the association between blood pressure and functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale, mRS) with multivariable regression. Lastly, we evaluated whether blood pressure explained the effect of CS on mRS. RESULTS In 440 patients with available blood pressure data, patients treated under CS (n = 262) had larger AUTs (median 228 vs 23 mm Hg*min), larger ∆LMAP (median 16% vs 6%) and a more negative blood pressure trend (-0.22 vs -0.08 mm Hg/min) compared to LA (n = 178).

In Mexico, the pandemic of COVID-19 hit hard and has raised challenges in trying to prevent parts of the population from falling back into extreme poverty. To better understand these challenges, we explore how federal government policy on the containment of COVID-19 has been applied in mountain regions during the first half-year of 2020 and describe how stakeholders working and living in the Valley of Mexico are coping with the situation (status: September 2020). Results from a systematic literature review and eight semi-structured interviews indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic underlined existing problems such as high rates of informal labor and income insecurity. We find that sources of contagion were linked to the organization of the food supply chain between city and mountain regions or to socio-cultural practices, and there are no specific strategies for helping people living and working in mountain regions to deal with the socio-economic effects of the pandemic. All respondents in our pilot study have been affected in some way by the pandemic: income loss, food security, or access/restriction to their workplaces. The majority of the respondents do not agree with the measures for containment of COVID-19 implemented by the federal government. We could identify coping mechanisms of our respondents, which include the reduction of consumption, diversification of income sources, and claiming support from the government. However, there is a legitimate threat of falling back to (extreme) poverty or experiencing social deprivation, if the challenges of the current pandemic will not be addressed quickly and more efficiently in the rural mountain areas of the Valley of Mexico. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",2021,"Kovács, B.; Benhumea, J.

Although TEEs have been promoted as the starting point for establishing a device root of trust, a number of published attacks against the most broadly utilized TEE implementations request a second view on their security. The aim of this research is to provide an analytical and educational exploration of TrustZone-based TEE vulnerabilities with the goal of pinpointing design and implementation flaws. To this end, we provide a taxonomy of TrustZone attacks, analyze them, and more importantly derive a set of critical observations regarding their nature. We perform a critical appraisal of the vulnerabilities to shed light on their underlying causes and we deduce that their manifestation is the joint effect of several parameters that lead to this situation. The most important ones are the closed implementations, the lack of security mechanisms, the shared resource architecture, and the absence of tools to audit trusted applications. Finally, given the severity of the identified issues, we propose possible improvements that could be adopted by TEE implementers to remedy and improve the security posture of TrustZone and future research directions.",2021-01-13,"Koutroumpouchos, Nikolaos; Ntantogian, Christoforos; Xenakis, Christos",Sensors (Basel),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/6df4a2f57c8d7c64405d9ace99de11b06c96dbc9.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7828402.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33450919/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21020520,231623214.0

Clues may lie with the predisposition to hypoxemia or unexpected absence of dyspnea (‘silent hypoxemia’) in some patients who later develop respiratory failure. Using a recently-validated breath-holding technique, we sought to test the hypothesis that gas exchange and ventilatory control deficits observed at admission are associated with subsequent adverse COVID-19 outcomes (composite primary outcome: non-invasive ventilatory support, intensive care admission, or death). METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 (N = 50) performed breath-holds to obtain measurements reflecting the predisposition to oxygen desaturation (mean desaturation after 20-s) and reduced chemosensitivity to hypoxic-hypercapnia (including maximal breath-hold duration). Associations with the primary composite outcome were modeled adjusting for baseline oxygen saturation, obesity, sex, age, and prior cardiovascular disease. Healthy controls (N = 23) provided a normative comparison. RESULTS: The adverse composite outcome (observed in N = 11/50) was associated with breath-holding measures at admission (likelihood ratio test, p = 0.020); specifically, greater mean desaturation (12-fold greater odds of adverse composite outcome with 4% compared with 2% desaturation, p = 0.002) and greater maximal breath-holding duration (2.7-fold greater odds per 10-s increase, p = 0.036). COVID-19 patients who did not develop the adverse composite outcome had similar mean desaturation to healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Breath-holding offers a novel method to identify patients with high risk of respiratory failure in COVID-19. Greater breath-hold induced desaturation (gas exchange deficit) and greater breath-holding tolerance (ventilatory control deficit) may be independent harbingers of progression to severe disease.

Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), administered every second week, has been proven to slow down disease progression and stabilize pulmonary function. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, ERT was interrupted at our centre for 29 days. As reports on ERT discontinuation in LOPD are rare, our study aimed to analyse the impact of ERT interruption on the change in clinical outcome. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study in 12 LOPD patients. Clinical assessments were performed after ERT interruption and after the next three consecutive infusions. We assessed motor function by muscle strength testing, a 6-minute-walk-test, pulmonary function tests, and adverse events. For statistical analysis, an estimated baseline was calculated based on the individual yearly decline. RESULTS: The mean time of ERT interruption was 49.42 days (SD ± 12.54). During ERT interruption, seven patients reported 14 adverse events and two of them were severe. Frequent symptoms were reduced muscle endurance/increased muscle fatigability and shortness of breath/worsening of breathing impairment. After ERT interruption, significant deterioration was found for MIP(%pred) (p = 0.026) and MRC(%pred), as well as a trend to clinical deterioration in FVC(%pred) and the 6MWT(%pred). CONCLUSION: Interruption of ERT was associated with a deterioration in the core clinical outcome measures. Therefore, an interruption of ERT should be kept as short as possible.

Often comorbid with insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and obesity, it also carries significant risk for the development of cardiovascular and metabolic sequelae, including diabetes and metabolic syndrome. The relationship between central obesity and the development of insulin resistance is widely verified. Adipose tissue excess and the coexistent dysregulation of adipocyte functions directly contribute to the pathogenesis of the metabolic complications observed in women with PCOS. In the light of these evidence, the most therapeutic option prescribed to obese women with PCOS, regardless of the phenotype e from the severity of clinical expression, is lifestyle correction by diet and physical activity. The aim of this study is to evaluate the beneficial effects of ketogenic diet in 17 obese women with PCOS. Our results showed that the ketogenic diet inducing therapeutic ketosis, improves the anthropometric and many biochemical parameters such as LH, FSH, SHBG, insulin sensitivity and HOMA index. In addition, it induces a reduction in androgenic production, whereas the contextual reduction of fat mass reduced the acyclic production of estrogens deriving from the aromatization in the adipose tissue of the androgenic excess, with an improvement of the LH/FSH ratio.

hjamaffv,,WHO,Prospective observational cohort study of factors influencing trial participation in people with motor neuron disease (FIT-participation-MND): a protocol,,,,unk,"INTRODUCTION: Motor neuron disease (MND) is a rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder with limited treatment options. The Motor Neuron Disease Systematic Multi-Arm Randomised Adaptive Trial (MND-SMART) is a multisite UK trial seeking to address the paucity in effective disease-modifying drugs for people with MND (pwMND). Historically, neurological trials have been plagued by suboptimal recruitment and high rates of attrition. Failure to recruit and/or retain participants can cause insufficiently representative samples, terminated trials or invalid conclusions. This study investigates patient-specific factors affecting recruitment and retention of pwMND to MND-SMART. Improved understanding of these factors may improve trial protocol design, optimise recruitment and retention. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PwMND on the Scottish MND Register, Clinical Audit Research and Evaluation of MND (CARE-MND), will be invited to participate in a prospective observational cohort study that investigates factors affecting trial participation and attrition. We hypothesise that patient-specific factors will significantly affect trial recruitment and retention. Participants will complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Form Y to evaluate neuropsychiatric symptoms, the ALS-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire-Brief Form and Centre for Disease Control and Prevention-Health-Related Quality of Life for quality of life and a novel study-specific questionnaire on Attitudes towards Clinical Trial Participation (ACT-Q). Clinical data on phenotype, cognition (Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen) and physical functioning (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised) will also be collated. Caregivers will complete the Brief Dimensional Apathy Scale. After 12 months, a data request to MND-SMART will evaluate recruitment and retention. Descriptive statistics will summarise and compare assessments and participants reaching impairment thresholds. Variable groupings: attitudes, quality of life, cognition, behaviour, physical functioning, neuropsychiatric and phenotype. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression will explore association with participation/withdrawal in MND-SMART; presented as ORs and 95% CIs.

Yet a systematic profiling of the aging effects on various hippocampal cell types in primates is still missing. Here, we reported a variety of new aging-associated phenotypic changes of the primate hippocampus. These include, in particular, increased DNA damage and heterochromatin erosion with time, alongside loss of proteostasis and elevated inflammation. To understand their cellular and molecular causes, we established the first single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas of primate hippocampal aging. Among the 12 identified cell types, neural transiently amplifying progenitor cell (TAPC) and microglia were most affected by aging. In-depth dissection of gene-expression dynamics revealed impaired TAPC division and compromised neuronal function along the neurogenesis trajectory; additionally elevated pro-inflammatory responses in the aged microglia and oligodendrocyte, as well as dysregulated coagulation pathways in the aged endothelial cells may contribute to a hostile microenvironment for neurogenesis. This rich resource for understanding primate hippocampal aging may provide potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic interventions against age-related neurodegenerative diseases.

This study is a retrospective observational study. Each of the corpse’s immediate family was explained the procedure for handling the body based on the fatwa of the religious institution and the hospital’s standard operating system. The acceptance or rejection of the protocol, general characteristics of the corpse, and the reasons for refusal are documented. RESULTS: From March to May 2020, there were 16 probable COVID-19 corpses and 3 confirmed COVID-19 corpses. Rejection of the COVID-19 corpse protocol occurred six times. The main reason for rejection is that the death might not necessarily be caused by COVID-19, the body’s handling in the hospital is not following religious law, and the negative stigma of COVID-19. From June to August 2020, there were 42 probable COVID-19 corpses and 49 confirmed COVID-19 corpses. Rejection of the COVID-19 corpse protocol occurred eight times.

The aerosol transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 is observed often associated with infection clusters under poorly ventilated environment. In the context of COVID-19 pandemic, significant transformation and optimization of traditional ventilation systems are needed. This paper is aimed to offer better understanding and insights into effective ventilation design to maximize its ability in airborne risk control, for particularly the COVID-19. Comprehensive reviews of each phase of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from source to receptor were conducted, so as to provide a theoretical basis for risk prediction and control. Infection risk models and their key parameters for risk assessment of SARS-CoV-2 are analyzed. Special focus is given on the efficacy of different ventilation strategies in mitigating airborne transmission. Ventilation interventions are found mainly impacting on the dispersion and inhalation phases of aerosol transmission. The airflow patterns become a key factor in controlling the aerosol diffusion and distribution.

Although such definitions should, ideally, be based on a standardized and fixed collection of defining criteria, they often require revision to reflect new knowledge of the condition involved and improvements in diagnostic testing. Optimal case definitions also need to have a balance of sensitivity and specificity that reflects their intended use. After the 2009–2010 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) initiated a technical consultation on global influenza surveillance. This prompted improvements in the sensitivity and specificity of the case definition for influenza – i.e. a respiratory disease that lacks uniquely defining symptomology. The revision process not only modified the definition of influenza-like illness, to include a simplified list of the criteria shown to be most predictive of influenza infection, but also clarified the language used for the definition, to enhance interpretability. To capture severe cases of influenza that required hospitalization, a new case definition was also developed for severe acute respiratory infection in all age groups. The new definitions have been found to capture more cases without compromising specificity.

Case reports in adults are traditionally described in severely immunocompromised individuals after organ transplant or in Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome. In this case we describe severe adenovirus pneumonia in a patient treated with monthly rituximab. CASE PRESENTATION: A 50 year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) treated with monthly rituximab, presents with 8 days of worsening dyspnea. He endorsed mild cough and abdominal discomfort. Two days prior, his dyspnea became severe. He and his wife, who works at a daycare center, tested negative in an outpatient center for COVID19 virus. He denied changes in taste, smell, chest pain or any known COVID19 contacts. Initial chest X-ray revealed multifocal opacities suggestive of bronchopneumonia. He was started on empiric cefepime and azithromycin. Inflammatory markers ferritin, D-dimer, CRP and ESR were elevated at 1257, 869, 184 and 63 respectively. His initial swab for COVID19 virus was negative. On admission, he required supplemental oxygen at 15L via non-rebreather mask to maintain oxygen saturation of 92-96%. Throughout his course, he was tested 6 times for COVID19 all of which resulted as negative. A respiratory viral panel sent on admission detected adenovirus. He was started on a treatment course of cidofovir with probenecid. Treatment initiation was delayed due to lag time of 9 days from the viral panel sent to the results becoming available. Unfortunately, after a prolonged hospital stay, he developed respiratory failure but elected to not be intubated. He became dependent on non-invasive ventilatory support and passed away on day 26 of admission. DISCUSSION: Rituximab is an off label therapy for MS. It acts as a chimeric monoclonal Bcell antiCD20 antibody, halting Bcell production, and reducing Tcell activation and antigen presentation 2. Patients taking rituximab are considered immunosuppressed and are at higher risk for infection;however, per our literature review, there have been no reported cases of adenovirus bronchopneumonia deaths associated with rituximab. Adenovirus is associated with classic ""flu like"" syndrome in children. In adults the virus is usually benign, presenting with mild gastrointestinal and less commonly mild upper respiratory symptoms 1. Patients undergoing rituximab treatment are at an increased risk of infection with hepatitis B, PML and PJP pneumonia 3,4. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment for severe adenovirus pneumonia is cidofovir and probenecid. Small studies have shown it to be efficacious in pediatric populations 5,6. Due to the high prevalence of COVID19, availability bias remained high and the negative predictive value of PCR tests were low 7. Despite negative PCR tests, the presence of adenovirus was thought of as a red herring leading to a 9 day delay in treatment. REFERENCE #1: M;, Lynch JP;Fishbein M;Echavarria. ""Adenovirus.""

METHODS: It is a prospective observational study. The study included healthy, not in labor, singleton pregnant women of 370/7-410/7 weeks who were applied to our hospital for routine obstetric control examination between March 1, 2020, and August 31, 2020. Patients were randomised by coin toss method. Oxygen saturation, systolic, and diastolic arterial blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and temperature of pregnant women using surgical masks and respiratory masks were measured before and after the non-stress test. The tolerance of the masks was also evaluated. Student's t-test was used for variables showing parametric distribution and the Mann Whitney U-test was used for non-parametric tests. The categorical variables between the groups was analyzed by using the Chi square test or Fisher Exact test. The statistical significance level was taken as p<0.05 in all tests. RESULTS: A total of 297 pregnant women using masks were included in the study. The effect of mask type on oxygen saturation before and after the non-stress test was found to be significant (97.1±1.8 corresponds to 95.3±2.6 for the surgical mask, p=0.0001; 97.8±1.7 corresponds to 93.7±2.0 for the respiratory mask, p=0.0001). Mask tolerance of patients using respiratory masks was significantly higher than those using surgical masks (mean 8, 1-10, p=0.0001).

wqod1bcc,,WHO,"COVID-19 related immunization disruptions in Rajasthan, India: A retrospective observational study",,,,unk,"INTRODUCTION: Governments around the world suspended immunization outreach to control COVID-19 spread. Many have since resumed services with an emphasis on catch-up vaccinations. This paper evaluated immunization disruptions during India's March-May 2020 lockdown and the extent to which subsequent catch-up efforts reversed them in Rajasthan, India. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we conducted phone surveys to collect immunization details for 2,144 children that turned one year old between January and October 2020. We used logistic regressions to compare differences in immunization timeliness and completed first-year immunization status among children that were due immunizations just before (unexposed), during (heavily exposed), and after (post-exposure) the lockdown. RESULTS: Relative to unexposed children, heavily exposed children were significantly less likely to be immunized at or before 9 months (OR 0.550; 95% CI 0.367-0.824; p = 0.004), but more likely to be immunized at 10-12 months (OR 1.761; 95% CI 1.196-2.591; p = 0.004). They were also less likely to have completed their key first-year immunizations (OR 0.624; 95% CI 0.478-0.816; p = 0.001) by the time of survey. In contrast, post-exposure children showed no difference in timeliness or completed first-year immunizations relative to unexposed children, despite their younger age. First-year immunization coverage among heavily exposed children decreased by 6.9 pp to 10.4 pp (9.7% to 14.0%). Declines in immunization coverage were larger among children in households that were poorer, less educated, lower caste, and residing in COVID red zones, although subgroup comparisons were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Disruptions to immunization services resulted in children missing immunization during the lockdown, but catch-up efforts after it was eased ensured many children were reached at later ages. Nevertheless, catch-up was incomplete and children due their immunizations during the lockdown remained less likely to be fully immunized 4-5 months after it lifted, even as younger cohorts due immunizations in June or later returned to pre-lockdown schedules.",2021,"Jain, Radhika; Chopra, Ambika; Falézan, Camille; Patel, Mustufa; Dupas, Pascaline",Vaccine,,#covidwho-1267953,,,,,227321480.0

djzhel1k,,WHO,Epithelial and Endothelial Expressions of ACE2: SARS-CoV-2 Entry Routes,,,,unk,"Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a main receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry to the host cell. ACE2 is one of the key enzymes in renin-angiotensin system and plays a vital role in the maintenance of cardiovascular function. ACE/ACE2 balance is critical in the regulation of blood pressure, electrolyte homeostasis, vascular and cardiac remodeling and inflammation. ACE2 was shown to be abundantly present in human epithelial cells of the lung and enterocytes of the small intestine as well as in endothelial cells of the arterial and venous vessels. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are colocalized on the cell surface and produced a critical step host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. TMPRSS2-cleaved ACE2 permits SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry however, ADAM17-cleaved ACE2 produces protective effects in several organs. Differently, basigin (CD147) was suggested as a putative alternate receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into endothelial cells. The intestinal ACE2 receptor is associated with the neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1 and ACE2 is necessary for the expression of this transporter on the luminal surface of intestinal epithelial cells. There is a good association between the localization of SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor ACE2 and the disease target organs in respiratory, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems. Decreased expression of ACE2, being a receptor for coronavirus, would prevent cellular entry of the virus thereby reducing progression of the infection. However, increased ACE2 expression produces beneficial health effects. Further studies are needed to clarify this conflicting situation. Currently, it is recommended to continue the therapy with ACE2-increasing drugs in patients with COVID-19.",2021,"Guney, Ceren; Akar, Fatma",J Pharm Pharm Sci,,#1100474,,,,,232047219.0

At first, this study comprehensively reviewed all databases related to phosphorylation sites (p-sites). Secondly, we introduced all steps regarding dataset creation, data preprocessing and method evaluation in p-sites prediction. Next, we investigated p-sites prediction methods which fall into two computational and Machine Learning (ML) groups. Additionally, it was shown that there are basically two main approaches for p-sites prediction by ML: conventional and End-to-End learning, which were given an overview for both of them. Moreover, this study introduced the most important feature extraction techniques which have mostly been used in ML approaches. Finally, we created three test sets from new proteins related to the 2022th released version of the dbPTM database based on general and human species.

In this case study, we examined the language fellows used in response to this encouragement, hypothesizing that they would engage in a variety of pandemic-related instructor talk, i.e., language that instructors use in the classroom that is not directly tied to educational content. We analyzed transcripts from 17 2-hour undergraduate biology seminar courses and found 167 instances of pandemic-related instructor talk. We used grounded theory to identify categories that emerged from these quotations: Positive coping mechanisms and self-care; Adjusting to online learning; Compassionate instruction; Personal impacts; COVID-19 and society; Dreaming; and Biology of COVID-19. Talk in these categories may help build relationships among instructors and students. The category about quickly Adjusting to online learning is unique, in that it is unlikely that there will be another time that will require simultaneous and rapid national movement to online instruction.

As governance agencies, professional practice, and academia work towards assessing, communicating, and addressing this risk, we ask: are existing gerontological conceptualisations of ageism appropriate for this exceptional situation and what is being (re)produced in terms of an aged subjectivity? Following van Dyk's (2016) critique of gerontology's 'othering' through both 'glorification' (third age) and 'abjection' (fourth age), a content analysis of statements and policy documents issued in response to COVID-19 provides evidence of well-meaning and inadvertent ageism through homogenizing language, the abjection/glorification binary within 'old age', and the power binary constructed between age and an age-neutral midlife. The paper concludes with reflections on future directions for ageism research beyond COVID-19.",2021,"Naughton, Linda; Padeiro, Miguel; Santana, Paula",J Aging Stud,,#covidwho-1232000,,,,,235336183.0

The cuff leak test is traditionally used to estimate the risk of this complication. However, the cuff leak test parameters are not constant and may depend on the respiratory system and ventilator settings. Furthermore, deflating the cuff also be a risk factor for patient-ventilator asynchrony and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Instead of using the cuff leak test, we measured the pressure of the leak to the upper airway through the gap between the tube and glottis with a constant low flow from the lumen above the cuff without deflating the cuff and called it ""pressure above the cuff."" The purpose of this study was to investigate whether pressure above the cuff can be used as an alternative to the cuff leak volume. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted at Kumamoto University Hospital after obtaining approval from the institutional review board. The pressure above the cuff was measured using an endotracheal tube with an evacuation lumen above the cuff and an automated cuff pressure modulation device. We pumped 0.16 L per minute of air and measured the steady-state pressure using an automated cuff pressure modulation device. Then, the cuff leak test was performed, and the cuff leak volume was recorded. The cuff leak volume was defined as the difference between the expiratory tidal volume with the cuff inflated and deflated. The relationship between the pressure above the cuff and cuff leak volume was evaluated. The patient-ventilator asynchrony during each measurement was also examined. RESULTS: The pressure above the cuff was measured, and the cuff leak volume was assessed 27 times. The pressure above the cuff was significantly correlated with the cuff leak volume (r = -0.76, p < 0.001). Patient-ventilator asynchrony was detected in 37% of measurements during the cuff leak test, but not during the pressure above the cuff test. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that pressure above the cuff measurement may be a less complicated alternative to the conventional cuff leak test for evaluation of the risk of post-extubation airway obstruction.

Despite the importance of cattle farming in Austria, little is known in this country about the abundance and distribution of bovine Eimeria spp. The objective of this study was to obtain detailed information about the occurrence of different Eimeria spp. on Austrian dairy farms. Fecal samples from individual calves (n = 868) from 296 farms all over Austria (82 districts) were collected. Additionally, each farmer was questioned about the occurrence of calf diarrhea, and about the knowledge on coccidiosis and possible control measures. On 97.97% of the investigated farms, calves excreted Eimeria oocysts, and 83.67% of the individual samples were positive. After sporulation of positive samples pooled from each farm, 11 Eimeria species were found, with E. bovis (in 65.54% of the samples and 27.74% of the farms), E.zuernii (63.85%/13.86%), E. auburnensis (56.76%/13.41%) and E. ellipsoidalis (54.05%/14.38%) being the most prevalent, followed by E. alabamensis (45.61%/11.56%), E. subspherica (35.14%/5.5.05%), E. cylindrica (33.11%/7.00%), and E. canadensis (31.08%/7.74%). E. wyomingensis, E. pellita and E. bukidnonensis were only found sporadically (3.04–4.73% of the samples and 0.16–0.59% of the farms). Mixed infections were present on all farms (2–9 Eimeria species/farm). Prevalences by state provinces were high throughout with 77.1–87.9% of the samples and 93.8–100% of the farms. Lower Austria had the highest percentage of positive farms, and Vorarlberg the lowest. Individual OPG (oocysts per gram of feces) values were generally low; 75% of the samples had an OPG of 1,000 or less. The highest detected OPG was 72,400. The mean OPG was 2,525 with above average numbers in Tirol, Carinthia, and Lower Austria. The mean OPG values were significantly positively correlated with the cattle density in the different districts. The majority of the samples were from female Simmenthal calves. Clinical coccidiosis (diarrhea) was observed in 74 cases, and (semi-)liquid diarrhea (56 animals) was significantly correlated with OPG (p < 0.05). Linear regression on the OPG data showed that OPG values significantly decreased with increasing age of the calves, while the percentage of positive samples increased with age (p < 0.05 for both). The term “coccidia” was familiar to 45% of the farmers, and anticoccidial treatment was performed by 13.51% of them, most commonly with toltrazuril. Considering the ubiquitous occurrence and the possible clinical and economic relevance of calf eimeriosis, infections should receive increased attention by both farmers and veterinarians.",2011-12-14,"Koutny, H.; Joachim, A.; Tichy, A.; Baumgartner, W.",Parasitol Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/01adbe8224d7723f2d5255c40e2e891def30039e.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7087621.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00436-011-2715-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22167365/,18829941.0

Antifungal resistance is frequent in molds, frequently leading to invasive mold infections (IMIs) in immunocompromised patients with high morbidity and mortality. Limited availability of effective antifungals for treatment of IMIs in China is an enormous challenge. The purpose of this study was to monitor in vitro antifungal resistance profiles of mold isolates from China, with a particular focus on evaluating in vitro isavuconazole (ISA) activity against these isolates, contributing to the treatment guidance in clinics. METHODS: We evaluated the in vitro activity of ISA and its comparators (voriconazole [VOR] and amphotericin B [AMB]) against 131 clinical isolates of Aspergillus spp. (n = 105) and Mucorales order (n = 26) collected between 2017 and 2020 from China. RESULTS: ISA and VOR exhibited similar in vitro activity against Aspergillus spp., with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)(50) of 1 µg/mL and MIC(90) of 2 µg/mL, respectively. Overall, AMB was less active than azoles against Aspergillus spp. (MIC(50): 4 µg/mL, MIC(90): 8 µg/mL). Against the Mucorales order, ISA demonstrated MIC(50) of 0.5 µg/mL and MIC(90) of 1 µg/mL; however, one strain each of Mucor circinelloides and Syncephalastrum racemosum were resistant to ISA (MICs: >8 µg/mL). VOR exhibited little or no activity (MIC(50): 8 µg/mL, MIC(90): >8 µg/mL) against the Mucorales order, whereas AMB had MIC(50) and MIC(90) of 1 µg/mL. CONCLUSION: This was the first multicenter, in vitro study conducted in China and demonstrated the excellent activities of ISA against most species of the Mucorales order. MIC indicated an advantage over currently available azole antifungals, positioning ISA as a potential alternative to VOR for clinical management of IMIs. As with other antimicrobials, clinicians should employ stewardship and best practices in relation to potential resistance to new azole antifungals.",2022-04-22,"Jing, Ran; Morrissey, Ian; Xiao, Meng; Sun, Tian-Shu; Zhang, Ge; Kang, Wei; Guo, Da-Wen; Aram, Jalal A; Wang, Jeffrey; Utt, Eric A; Wang, Yao; Xu, Ying-Chun",Infect Drug Resist,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/0fae07a114ad56fa455a641baff2b4c5236599fb.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC9041355.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35498631/; https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s360191,248338231.0

The EDI has not been independently evaluated, and other proprietary models have been shown to be biased against vulnerable populations. Objectives: To independently evaluate the EDI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 overall and in disproportionately affected subgroups. Methods: We studied adult patients admitted with COVID-19 to units other than the intensive care unit at a large academic medical center from March 9 through May 20, 2020. We used the EDI, calculated at 15-minute intervals, to predict a composite outcome of intensive care unit–level care, mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death. In a subset of patients hospitalized for at least 48 hours, we also evaluated the ability of the EDI to identify patients at low risk of experiencing this composite outcome during their remaining hospitalization. Results: Among 392 COVID-19 hospitalizations meeting inclusion criteria, 103 (26%) met the composite outcome. The median age of the cohort was 64 (interquartile range, 53–75) with 168 (43%) Black patients and 169 (43%) women. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of the EDI was 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.74–0.84). EDI predictions did not differ by race or sex. When exploring clinically relevant thresholds of the EDI, we found patients who met or exceeded an EDI of 68.8 made up 14% of the study cohort and had a 74% probability of experiencing the composite outcome during their hospitalization with a sensitivity of 39% and a median lead time of 24 hours from when this threshold was first exceeded. Among the 286 patients hospitalized for at least 48 hours who had not experienced the composite outcome, 14 (13%) never exceeded an EDI of 37.9, with a negative predictive value of 90% and a sensitivity above this threshold of 91%. Conclusions: We found the EDI identifies small subsets of high-risk and low-risk patients with COVID-19 with good discrimination, although its clinical use as an early warning system is limited by low sensitivity.

Electron micrographs of two strains of rotavirus, bovine rotavirus C486 and rhesus rotavirus, show that virally mediated cell-cell fusion occurs within 1 h postinfection. Trypsin activation is necessary for rotavirus to mediate cell-cell fusion. The extent of fusion is relative to the amount of virus used, and maximum fusion occurs between pHs 6.5 and 7.5. Fusion does not require virus-induced protein synthesis, as virus from both an empty capsid preparation and from an EDTA-treated preparation, which is noninfectious, can induce fusion. Incubation of rotavirus with neutralizing and nonneutralizing monoclonal antibodies before addition to cells indicates that viral protein 4 (VP4; in the form of VP5* and VP8*) and VP7 are involved in fusion. Light and electron micrographs document this fusion, including the formation of pores or channels between adjacent fused cells. These data support direct membrane penetration as a possible route of infection.

However, the availability of these drugs is limited by their high cost. Infliximab was the first biologic to be approved for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). After its patent expired other manufactures developed biosimilar versions, among which CT-P13, and licensed them thorough an expedite process. AREAS COVERED: The aim of this review is to summarize the available evidence on CT-P13 use in IBD, with particular interest in the phase II trials of a subcutaneous version of CT-P13. EXPERT OPINION: Biosimilars, such as CT-P13, are an important resource for health-care systems. Although CT-P13 approval in IBD was based on extrapolation, subsequent studies confirmed its clinical equivalence to originator infliximab. A new subcutaneous formulation of CT-P13 showed promising results in phase I and II trials in both CD and UC. Clinical efficacy and safety were comparable and interestingly serum drug doses appeared to be more stable than conventional intravenous CT-P13. If these preliminary results will be confirmed, the first sub-cutaneous version of infliximab could soon be available for IBD.",2020,"Parigi, Tommaso Lorenzo; D039,; Amico, Ferdinando; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent; Danese, Silvio",Expert Opin Biol Ther,,#721871,,,,,221142781.0

The logic was to reduce disease transmission by controlling population circulation at any one time. We sought to understand the impact of this policy approach on Panamanian society. To do so, we undertook key informant interviews with representatives from groups of society which have been significantly affected by this policy across Panamanian society. Framework analysis was undertaken on interview transcripts to identify key trends, which were latterly triangulated with academic, media and grey literature. Firstly, we engage with intersectional analyses to show that those most affected were marginalised groups including trans population, disabled groups, indigenous groups and migrants who faced discrimination as a consequence of this policy. Secondly, we highlight practical tensions that individuals faced relating to access to resources (financial, health-related and beyond), and third we interrogate the methods used to enforce this policy, and the role of the police and exemption passes. We conclude that this policy was regressive in that it affected those most vulnerable in Panamanian society, entrenching existing inequalities.

Thus, treating these diseases in their early stages can improve the quality and quantity of the product. Recently, several robotic frameworks based on image processing and artificial intelligence have been used to treat these diseases in an automated way. However, incorrect diagnosis of the infected leaf can lead to the use of chemical treatments for normal leaf thereby the issue will not be solved, and the process may be costly and harmful. To overcome these issues, a modern deep learning framework in robot vision for the early detection of bean leaves diseases is proposed. The proposed framework is composed of two primary stages, which detect the bean leaves in the input images and diagnosing the diseases within the detected leaves. The U-Net architecture based on a pre-trained ResNet34 encoder is employed for detecting the bean leaves in the input images captured in uncontrolled environmental conditions. In the classification stage, the performance of five diverse deep learning models (e.g., Densenet121, ResNet34, ResNet50, VGG-16, and VGG-19) is assessed accurately to identify the healthiness of bean leaves.

Nanoalgosomes are a subtype of EVs recently identified and isolated from microalgae. Microalgae represent a natural bioresource with the capacity to produce several secondary metabolites with a broad range of biological activities and commercial applications. The present study highlights the upstream and downstream processes required for the scalable production of nanoalgosomes from cultures of the marine microalgae Tetraselmis chuii. Different technical parameters, protocols, and conditions were assessed to improve EVs isolation by tangential flow filtration (TFF), aiming to enhance sample purity and yield. The optimization of the overall bioprocess was enhanced by quality control checks operated through robust biophysical and biochemical characterizations. Further, we showed the possibility of recycling by TFF microalgae cells post-EVs isolation for multiple EV production cycles.

d48x2o2p,,WHO,Use of Viral Filter to Reduce Exposure to Exhaled Aerosol Does Not Affect Methacholine Dose Delivery during Bronchoprovocation Testing,10.1016/j.chest.2021.07.2048,,,unk,"TOPIC: Respiratory Care TYPE: Original Investigations PURPOSE: Methacholine challenge testing (MCT) is a common bronchoprovocation technique used to assess airway hyperresponsiveness. Current ERS guidelines recommend that measures should be taken to minimize technician exposure to methacholine aerosol, with added infection control concerns in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We previously demonstrated that the addition of a viral filter to the nebulizer exhalation limb reduced expelled particle concentrations by 77-91% during MCT. Our aim was to evaluate whether this modification resulted in a change in the delivered dose of methacholine. METHODS: Following published industry testing standards for MCT, we connected a Hamilton-G5 mechanical ventilator and Michigan lung simulator in series with respiratory rate 15 breaths/min, tidal volume (VT) 500 mL, I:E ratio 1:1 with a sinusoidal waveform. We compared methacholine dose delivery using the Hudson MicroMist and AeroEclipse II BAN nebulizers powered by either a dry gas source at 50 psi and 4.5 L/min or the Ombra compressor system, in addition to our current MCT protocol which utilizes Hudson MicroMist nebulizer with KoKo dosimeter (3 breaths). A filter placed in line between the nebulizer and test lung was weighed before and after 1 minute of nebulized methacholine delivery. Mean inhaled mass was calculated from three trials of each method with and without a viral filter on the exhalation limb. Dose delivery was calculated by multiplying the mean inhaled mass by the respirable fraction (particles < 5 µm) and inhalation time. Unpaired t-test was used to compare methacholine dose delivery with and without viral filter placement. Due to multiple independent comparisons, Bonferroni correction was used and alpha level was set at 0.01. RESULTS: The addition of a viral filter did not significantly affect methacholine dose delivery across all devices tested. Using the 50 psi dry gas source, dose delivered with the Hudson MicroMist did not differ with (461.0 µg) or without (307.8 µg) a viral filter (P=0.11) or with the AeroEclipse II BAN with (580.8 µg) or without (678.4) a viral filter (P=0.59). Using the Ombra compressor, dose delivered with the Hudson MicroMist did not differ with (1063.3 µg) or without (947.5 µg) a viral filter (P=0.026) or with AeroEclipse II BAN with (843.8 µg) or without (648.3) viral filter (P=0.42). Dose delivery did not differ significantly when using the KoKo dosimeter and Hudson MicroMist with or without a viral filter (P=0.20) using a 3-breath protocol. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of a viral filter to the nebulizer expiratory limb did not result in a significant change in the in the delivered dose of methacholine. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Based on these findings, use of a viral filter to limit the concentration of expelled aerosol during MCT should be considered to improve pulmonary function technician safety and potentially reduce the risk of infectious exposure during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The objective of this study was to describe treatment patterns and outcomes in non-transplant NDMM in four European countries. METHODS: This retrospective chart review included adults with NDMM diagnosed between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2013 (early cohort) or April 1, 2016 and March 31, 2017 (recent cohort). RESULTS: Among 836 patients, molecular testing was performed in 21% and 35% patients of early vs. recent cohorts; proteasome inhibitor (PI)/alkylator combinations were the principal first-line (1L) therapy (39% vs. 43%). Use of immunomodulatory drug (IMID)/alkylator combinations declined from early to recent cohort (26% vs. 13%) but IMID (7% vs. 16%) use increased. Few patients (5%) received 1L maintenance therapy. Two-thirds of patients were treated with a fixed duration intent, with a median 7-month 1L DOT and progression-free survival (PFS) of 32.8 months in the early cohort.

3vd9hm2m,,WHO,Long COVID and its associated factors among COVID survivors in the community from a middle-income country: an online cross-sectional study,,,,unk,"IntroductionPatients with COVID-19 usually recover and return to normal health, however some patients may have symptoms that last for weeks or even months after recovery. This persistent state of ill health is known as Long COVID if it continues for more than 12 weeks and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis. Long Covid has been overlooked in low and middle income countries. Therefore, we conducted an online survey among the COVID-19 survivors in the community to explore their Long COVID symptoms, factors associated with Long COVID and how Long COVID affected their work. MethodsThis was a cross sectional study conducted from July to September 2021, during the implementation of a nationwide movement control order (MCO). Data was collected using the REDCap electronic data capture tool. The questionnaire was distributed in social and news media. The questionnaire covers information such as socio-demographic characteristics, existing comorbidities, self-perception on health, information on the acute COVID-19 condition and treatment received, symptoms and duration of post-COVID condition and effects on occupation. Results: A total of 732 COVID-19 survivors responded. There were slightly more females (58.7%), younger and more highly educated respondents. More than half of them were overweight or obese and about two third were free of comorbidities. Among these respondents, about 56% were without or with mild symptoms during their acute COVID-19 conditions. A total of 21.1% of the respondents reported to experience Long COVID. The most commonly reported symptoms for Long COVID were fatigue, brain fog, depression, anxiety, insomnia, arthralgia or myalgia. Females had 58% higher odds (95% CI: 1.02, 2.45) of experiencing Long COVID. Patients with moderate and severe levels of acute COVID-19 symptoms had OR of 3.01 (95% CI: 1.21, 7.47) and 3.62 (95% CI: 1.31, 10.03) respectively for Long COVID. ConclusionThis study provides additional insight on the symptoms and duration of post-COVID symptoms as well as the associated factors with Long COVID among COVID-19 survivors in Malaysia. Recognition of Long COVID and its associated factors is important in planning prevention, rehabilitation, clinical management to improve recovery and long-term COVID-19 outcomes.",2022,"Moy, Foong Ming; Hairi, Noran Naqiah; Lim, Eugene Ri Jian; Bulgiba, Awang",,,#ppmedrxiv-22272168,,,,,247408028.0

Although the use of single-stranded oligonucleotides (ssODN) as an HDR donor has improved the integration of smaller transgenes, they do not support efficient insertion of large DNA sequences. In an effort to gain insights into the mechanism(s) governing the HDR-mediated integration of larger transgenes and to improve the technology, we conducted knock-in experiments targeting the human EMX1 locus and applied rigorous genomic PCR analyses in the human HEK293 cell line. This exercise revealed an unexpected molecular complication arising from the transgene HDR being initiated at the single homology arm and the subsequent genomic integration of plasmid backbone sequences. To pivot around this problem, we devised a novel PCR-constructed template containing blocked long 3' single-stranded overhangs (BL3SSO) that greatly improved the efficiency of bona fide Cas9-stimulated HDR at the EMX1 locus. We further refined BL3SSO technology and successfully used it to insert GFP transgenes into two important interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) loci, Viperin/RSAD2, and ISG15.

Zoster Vaccine Live (ZVL or Zostavax™), has been licensed in the U.S. since 2006 to prevent herpes zoster. ZVL protection has been shown to wane with time and estimates of effect can be imprecise. We performed a systematic review of the duration of efficacy and effectiveness of ZVL against herpes zoster (HZ). METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and clinicaltrials.gov for vaccine efficacy or effectiveness (VE) studies of ZVL. Two authors independently screened each title and abstract, and potential VE studies were reviewed in-depth. Eligibility criteria included original data on ZVL prevention of HZ in a general population of immunocompetent recipients ≤ 60 years old. Selected articles were abstracted, independently reviewed, and discrepancies adjudicated. We attempted to locate relevant unpublished work and contacted authors for additional data, where necessary. Measures of association were illustrated on a forest plot and converted to VE (1-hazard ratio or risk ratio or odds ratio). RESULTS: We screened 1302 articles; 17 underwent full text review and 8 met inclusion criteria and were abstracted for this review. Selected studies included 1 phase III randomized controlled trial, 2 quasi experimental and 5 observational studies. One experimental and 5 observational studies estimated VE during the period from vaccination up to 4 years following vaccination; estimates across studies ranged from 33%-55%. Two quasi experimental and 3 observational studies estimated VE for ≥ 4 years following vaccination; estimates ranged from 19%-40%; the median estimate was 24% (Figure). Pooled VE was not calculated due to heterogeneity in length of follow up, age distribution of study subjects, as well as adjustment for factors such as underlying medical conditions. CONCLUSION: Most experimental and observational studies estimate VE just above 50% during the 3 years following receipt of ZVL. Beyond 3 years, ZVL protection wanes, with most studies estimating a VE of ≤24% after 4 years. Information on overall efficacy and duration of protection from ZVL will guide policy decisions regarding its use. DISCLOSURES: E.

Round table: Governing digital transformations in health: Shaping the digital future of Europe,10.1093/eurpub/ckab164.549,,,unk,"Digital and data tools are fundamentally changing approaches to health and the design of health systems and health services deliver, but governance models have neither followed nor kept up with the pace of innovation. In response to this challenge, The Lancet & Financial Times Commission Governing health futures 2030: Growing up in a digital world is exploring the convergence of digital health (DH), AI, and other frontier technologies with UHC to support attainment of SDG 3. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges, with serious implications for public health and healthcare systems worldwide. With online work and education having become the new norm, the COVID-19 pandemic has exponentially heightened the need to develop digital skills and literacy, while simultaneously revealing and exacerbating existing disparities in digital access and skills, thus widening existing digital divides. That being said, COVID-19 has accelerated the radical implementation and widespread adoption of digital technologies, providing opportunities for improved overall health and well-being outcomes, which may extend well into the future if appropriately and sustainably implemented, evaluated, and most importantly, governed. The findings and recommendations arising from the Commission's report, which will be presented and discussed, are fully aligned with this year's conference theme, “Public health futures in a changing world.” From the outset, the Commission framed its work through the notion that digital transformations, and the technologies that drive them, must be led by public value and governed to benefit population health and well-being. With growing investment in DH technologies in Europe, and increased recognition of governance challenges related to this field, this workshop offers an important and timely opportunity to present the Commission's work and discuss the implications of its findings and recommendations for European countries. The discussion in this workshop will centre around a set of critical questions, drawing from the experiences of experts involved in governance in the European context: Is the European DH ecosystem fit for purpose? To what extent is Europe's current legislative ecosystem and technical infrastructure capable of hosting digital transformations in health? Will the EHDS succeed in promoting citizens' control over their health data across Europe? How can national/regional approaches to governance of digital technologies and data better support public health outcomes and ensure that all Europeans can benefit from digital transformations in health and that no one is left behind? Workshop format: Opening remarks from each speaker to contextualise their work on DH governance in Europe and respond to the Commission's work (5 mins. each) Moderated roundtable discussion between panellists (15 mins.) Hearing & addressing audience questions/concerns (20 mins.) After the workshop, a policy brief and accompanying news article will be shared on the Commission's website.

To determine the colonization ability of E. coli 3D8scFv, E. coli cells with or without the 3D8scFv gene were fed to mice. Total DNA was extracted from the animals’ stools, stomach, small intestine and colon. All samples were amplified using 3D8scFv gene-specific primer sets.

Computationally predicting the structure of a protein from its primary sequence has long been a grand challenge in bioinformatics, intimately connected with understanding protein chemistry and dynamics. Recent advances in deep learning, combined with the availability of genomic data for inferring co-evolutionary patterns, provide a new approach to protein structure prediction that is complementary to longstanding physics-based approaches. The outstanding performance of AlphaFold2 in the recent Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14) experiment demonstrates the remarkable power of deep learning in structure prediction. In this perspective, we focus on the key features of AlphaFold2, including its use of (i) attention mechanisms and Transformers to capture long-range dependencies, (ii) symmetry principles to facilitate reasoning over protein structures in three dimensions and (iii) end-to-end differentiability as a unifying framework for learning from protein data.

This challenge has resulted in the forced adoption of social distancing measures and reorganization of the delivery of medical and psychological treatments. The perceived loneliness and uncertainty increased distress and symptoms burden. In the current period, eHealth interventions might provide valuable benefits in the field of cancer care. Objective: The overall goal of the study protocol will be to provide an innovative intervention for cancer patients based on an online platform, to help them manage and prevent psychological problems related to social isolation. Specifically, the efficacy of two web-based interventions aimed at lowering stress in cancer patients will be tested and compared. Methods: One hundred and fifty participants (75 per group) will be enrolled in a two-group randomized trial. The two interventions will be composed either by exercises on relaxation and meditation practices, presented in both automated online content and interactive group sessions or by fixed psychoeducational online content. Stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, distress, resilience, and perceived social isolation will be measured before the start of the interventions (T0), 2 weeks (T1), 4 weeks (T2), and 2 months (T3) after the beginning of the interventions in both groups. A repeated measures ANOVA will be performed to test differences in the questionnaires' scores between groups across the four-time points. Expected Results: We hypothesized greater improvement in the specific domain of stress symptoms (IES-R) assessed in the group receiving the interactive intervention, compared to the group which will receive only fully automated psychoeducational content. Secondarily, we expect the same trend of improvement across all the psychological variables in the blended intervention group. Conclusions: Implementing these practices on people who are forced into mandatory social isolation may help them become more aware of their mind-body condition and reduce negative effects. Moreover, relaxation techniques help individuals in achieving a greater state of well-being, increasing the ability to cope with stressful situations (resilience), and strengthening the immune system.",2021-10-13,"Marzorati, Chiara; Pizzoli, Silvia Francesca Maria; Grasso, Roberto; Pravettoni, Gabriella",Front Psychol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e4909ae41e4a6bebd0b4fde3e9d492461c215796.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8548685.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.710861; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34721155/,238639536.0
llurh1b4,,WHO,Micronutrient zinc roles in adjunctive therapy for COVID-19 by enhancing patients immunoregulation and tolerance to the pathogen,,,,unk,"SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) has caused a high number of hospitalizations and deaths. There are currently no approved antiviral drugs or vaccine options available for treatment. Patients with severe cases of COVID-19 are receiving supportive care to manage life-threatening symptoms of viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Clinical and pathological evidence suggests that patients with severe COVID-19 infections suffer from cytokine storm syndrome, which leads to unfavorable health outcomes. Unfortunately, the conventional pharmacotherapies for cytokine storm syndrome are associated with immunosuppression and various other side effects that may worsen the patients' health status and healing capability. This study is to review the literature on how zinc status may affect susceptibility and outcomes of a viral infection, as well as to explore the possible beneficial effects of supplementing zinc to alleviate COVID-19 duration and severity. We propose zinc supplementation as a viable therapeutic approach when used alone or in combination with other drugs to combat cytokine storm syndrome in COVID-19 patients. The supplementation may be especially effective for elderly patients or patients with co-morbidity already deficient in zinc. More level I randomized controlled studies are needed to determine the clinical efficacy of zinc supplementation as a potential low-cost intervention to reduce morbidity and mortality due to pneumonia and ARDS in COVID-19 patients.

Colloidal growth techniques, such as antisolvent precipitation, form dispersions with properties that match bulk layered R-P phases, but controlling the composition of these particles remains challenging. Here, we explore the microstructure of particles of R-P phases of methylammonium lead iodide prepared by antisolvent precipitation from ternary mixtures of alkylammonium cations, where one cation can form perovskite phases (CH3NH3+) and the other two promote layered structures as spacers (e.g., C4H9NH3+ and C12H25NH3+). We determine that alkylammonium spacers pack with constant methylene density in the R-P interlayer and exclude interlayer solvent in dispersed colloids, regardless of length or branching. Using this result, we illustrate how the competition between cations that act as spacers between layers, or as grain-terminating ligands, determines the colloidal microstructure of layered R-P crystallites in solution. Optical measurements reveal that quantum well dimensions can be tuned by engineering the ternary cation composition. Transmission synchrotron wide-angle X-ray scattering and small-angle neutron scattering reveal changes in the structure of colloids in solvent and after deposition into thin films. In particular, we find that spacers can alloy between R-P layers if they share common steric arrangements, but tend to segregate into polydisperse R-P phases if they do not mix. This study provides a framework to compare the microstructure of colloidal layered perovskites and suggests clear avenues to control phase and colloidal morphology.",2020-08-24,"Dahlman, Clayton J; Venkatesan, Naveen R; Corona, Patrick T; Kennard, Rhys M; Mao, Lingling; Smith, Noah C; Zhang, Jiamin; Seshadri, Ram; Helgeson, Matthew E; Chabinyc, Michael L",ACS nano,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c03219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830961/,221282508.0

Biosimilar market uptake greatly depends on health care provider willingness to promote, prescribe, and use biosimilars in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE To perform a systematic review evaluating current U.S. and European health care provider knowledge, perceptions, and prescribing behaviors of biosimilar medicines to assess the need for clinician-directed biosimilar education. METHODS An electronic literature search was conducted using journal databases, including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Terms related to biosimilar agents, survey questionnaires, and education were used. Two independent reviewers evaluated 158 citations published from January 1, 2014, to March 5, 2018 that were the result of this search. Studies in English were included if they surveyed U.S. or European physician and/or pharmacist knowledge, attitudes, and/or prescribing preferences of biosimilar drugs. Overall trends in prescribing behavior and perceptions were abstracted. RESULTS A total of 20 studies met inclusion criteria. Three studies originated from the United States and 17 were from Europe. Hospital specialists, gastroenterologists, and rheumatologists were the most frequently surveyed practitioners. The percentage of biosimilar prescribing varied widely between countries and within similar practice fields. If used, biosimilars were predominantly prescribed in biologic treatment-naive patients. An overall lack of biosimilar familiarity in U.S. and European health care settings accompanied concerns about biosimilar safety, efficacy, extrapolation, and interchangeability. Detailed descriptions of biosimilar education programs were lacking within the literature. CONCLUSIONS Findings from this review indicate that U.S. and European health care providers still approach biosimilar medicines with caution, citing limited biosimilar knowledge, low prescribing comfort, and safety and efficacy concerns as main deterrents for biosimilar use. To realize the full cost-saving potential of biosimilar medicines, clinician-directed biosimilar education will be imperative to address gaps in biosimilar knowledge, facilitate prescribing changes, and ultimately increase biosimilar use.

METHODS: One IgM(+) and IgG(−), 32 IgM(+) and IgG(+), 38 IgM(−) and IgG(+), and 40 IgM(−) and IgG(−) patients were included. Demographic data were collected. IgM and IgG antibodies, hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and lymphocyte subsets in serum were determined at weeks 0, 2 and 4. RESULTS: The hs-CRP and IL-6 levels of all patients were within the normal ranges. The number of patients with all lymphocyte subset testing items within normal ranges was 12/110 (10.9%) at week 0, 15/110 (13.6%) at week 2 and 18/110 (16.4%) at week 4. The percentages of CD8 + cells, NK cells and B lymphocytes in the IgM(+) and IgG(+) group were quite different from those in the IgM(−) and IgG(+) group and the IgM(−) and IgG(−) group, with much higher percentages of CD8 + cells and much lower percentages of NK cells and B lymphocytes at weeks 0, 2 and 4. Twelve IgM(+) patients in the IgM(+) and IgG(+) group converted to IgM(−), and the percentages of NK cells and B lymphocytes in these patients were significantly increased at week 4.

In fact, LNPs are currently being used in the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. Cationic LNPs composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP)/cholesterol (chol) LNPs have been classified as one of the most efficient gene delivery systems and are being tested in numerous clinical trials. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of the molar ratio of DOTAP/chol, PEGylation, and lipid to mRNA ratio on mRNA transfection, and explore the applications of DOTAP/chol LNPs in pDNA and oligonucleotide transfection. Here we showed that PEGylation significantly decreased mRNA transfection efficiency of DOTAP/chol LNPs. Among non-PEGylated LNP formulations, 1:3 molar ratio of DOTAP/chol in DOTAP/chol LNPs showed the highest mRNA transfection efficiency. Furthermore, the optimal ratio of DOTAP/chol LNPs to mRNA was tested to be 62.5 µM lipid to 1 μg mRNA. More importantly, these mRNA-loaded nanoparticles were stable for 60 days at 4 °C storage without showing reduction in transfection efficacy. We further found that DOTAP/chol LNPs were able to transfect pDNA and oligonucleotides, demonstrating the ability of these LNPs to transport the cargo into the cell nucleus. The influence of various factors in the formulation of DOTAP/chol cationic LNPs is thus described and will help improve drug delivery of nucleic acid–based vaccines and therapies.

However, there are still two unsolved issues hindering the practice. First, collected datasets for model training are often imbalanced, with a considerably smaller proportion of users tested positive, making it harder to learn representative and robust features. Second, deep learning models are generally overconfident in their predictions. Clinically, false predictions aggravate healthcare costs. Estimation of the uncertainty of screening would aid this. To handle these issues, we propose an ensemble framework where multiple deep learning models for sound-based COVID-19 detection are developed from different but balanced subsets from original data. As such, data are utilized more effectively compared to traditional up-sampling and down-sampling approaches: an AUC of 0.74 with a sensitivity of 0.68 and a specificity of 0.69 is achieved. Simultaneously, we estimate uncertainty from the disagreement across multiple models. It is shown that false predictions often yield higher uncertainty, enabling us to suggest the users with certainty higher than a threshold to repeat the audio test on their phones or to take clinical tests if digital diagnosis still fails. This study paves the way for a more robust sound-based COVID-19 automated screening system.

METHODS: One hundred twenty-eight consecutive patients with T2DM (median age 70 years, 74 males) were retrospectively evaluated at the end of the lockdown period. Data on metabolic control were collected at different time: within three months before the lockdown (visit 0) and within the first six weeks after it (visit 1). RESULTS: During the lockdown, a significant increase in body weight (from 79.7 ± 18.7 kg to 81.4 ± 19.4 kg, p < 0.001), body mass index (BMI, from 29.5 ± 6 kg/m2 to 30.1 ± 6.3 kg/m2, p < 0.001), waist circumference (from 103.8 ± 13 cm to 105 ± 13.6 cm, p < 0.001), fasting plasma glucose (FPG; from 138.1 ± 29.4 mg/dL to 146.6 ± 36.4 mg/dL) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c; from 7 ± 0.8 to 7.3 ± 0.9%, p < 0.001) was observed.

A corollary benefit is a potential fit in terms of the need for equitable and timely access to mental health services in remote and rural locations. Owing to COVID-19, there may be an increase in the demand for timely, virtual delivery of services among trauma-affected populations, including public safety personnel (PSP; eg, paramedics, police, fire, correctional officers), military members, and veterans. There is a lack of evidence on the question of whether digital delivery of trauma-therapies for military members, veterans, and PSP leads to similar outcomes to in-person delivery. Information on barriers and facilitators and recommendations regarding digital-delivery is also scarce. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the scope and quality of peer-reviewed literature on psychotherapeutic digital health interventions delivered remotely to military members, veterans, and PSP and synthesize the knowledge of needs, gaps, barriers to, and facilitators for virtual assessment of and virtual interventions for posttraumatic stress injury. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified using MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica dataBASE), APA (American Psychological Association) PsycINFO, CINAHL (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature) Plus with Full Text, and Military & Government Collection. For collation, analysis, summarizing, and reporting of results, we used the CASP (Critical Skills Appraisal Program) qualitative checklist, PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) scale, level of evidence hierarchy, PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews), and narrative synthesis. RESULTS: A total of 38 studies were included in this review. Evidence for the effectiveness of digital delivery of prolonged exposure therapy, cognitive processing therapy, behavioral activation treatment with therapeutic exposure to military members, veterans, and PSP was rated level 1a, whereas evidence for cognitive behavioral therapy was conflicting. The narrative synthesis indicated that virtual delivery of these therapies can be as effective as in-person delivery but may reduce stigma and cost while increasing access to therapy. Issues of risk, safety, potential harm (ie, suicidality, enabling avoidance), privacy, security, and the match among the therapist, modality, and patient warrant further consideration. There is a lack of studies on the influences of gender, racial, and cultural factors that may result in differential outcomes, preferences, and/or needs. An investigation into other therapies that may be suitable for digital delivery is needed. CONCLUSIONS: Digital delivery of trauma therapies for military members, veterans, and PSP is a critical area for further research.

Understood as both a source of and a threat to individual and collective bodies’ ontological security, in this article I explain how taking the process of (re/dis)embodiment into account entails widening and deepening OSS to allow for the consideration and appreciation of how individual and collective bodies are continually, simultaneously, materially, and ideationally contested. As a primarily theoretical contribution, this is done through an interdisciplinary approach bringing Achille Mbembe's necropolitical theory into conversation with Sara Ahmed's theses on willfulness and use and is illustrated through discussions on the body politics of the COVID-19 pandemic. In short, I argue that, under conditions of contemporary global necropolitics, individuals’ ontological security as bodies becomes increasingly threatened according to raced, classed, and gendered local–global hierarchies which determine the reduction and use of individuals to the status of parts within collectives that are themselves embodied and increasingly unfit for the purpose of healthy living, especially in a time of pandemic.",2021-11-09,"Purnell, Kandida",,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/cfdc70c8d35548ca7c1fa0011464912b348ebe82.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8689955.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8689955/,

We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 samples collected from various regions of Slovakia between November and December 2020 that were presumed to contain B.1.1.7 variant due to drop-out of the Spike gene target in an RT-qPCR test caused by this deletion. Sequencing of these samples revealed that although in some cases the samples were indeed confirmed as B.1.1.7, a substantial fraction of samples contained another ∆H69/∆V70 carrying mutant belonging to the lineage B.1.258, which has been circulating in Central Europe since August 2020, long before the import of B.1.1.7. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the early sublineage of B.1.258 acquired the N439K substitution in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the Spike protein and, later on, also the deletion ∆H69/∆V70 in the Spike N-terminal domain (NTD). This variant was particularly common in several European countries including the Czech Republic and Slovakia but has been quickly replaced by B.1.1.7 early in 2021.

It has become very urgent and important to develop a bivalent vaccine that is able to target these two infectious diseases simultaneously. In this study, we generated three attenuated replicating recombinant VSV (rVSV) vaccine candidates. These rVSV-based vaccines co-express SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant spike protein (SP) or the receptor binding domain (RBD) and four copies of the highly conserved M2 ectodomain (M2e) of influenza A fused with the Ebola glycoprotein DC-targeting/activation domain. Animal studies have shown that immunization with these bivalent rVSV vaccines induced efficient but variable levels of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza M2e protein. Significantly, our vaccine candidates induced production of high levels of neutralizing antibodies that protected cells against SARS-CoV-2 Delta and other SP-pseudovirus infections in culture. Furthermore, vaccination with the bivalent VSV vaccine via either intramuscular or intranasal route efficiently protected mice from the lethal challenge of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses and significantly reduced viral load in the lungs. These studies provide convincing evidence for the high efficacy of this bivalent vaccine to prevent influenza replication and initiate robust immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 Delta variants. Further investigation of its efficacy to protect against SARS-CoV-2 Delta variants will provide substantial evidence for new avenues to control two contagious respiratory infections, COVID-19 and influenza.",2021,"Ao, Zhujun; Ouyang, Maggie Jing; Olukitibi, Titus Abiola; Warner, Bryce; Vendramelli, Robert; Truong, Thang; Zhang, Manli; Fowke, Keith R; Kobasa, Darwyn; Yao, Xiaojian",,,#ppbiorxiv-472657,,,,,245271991.0

Apoptosis is considered to be one of the pathogenetic mechanisms in steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). Therefore, we performed this study to investigate whether gastrodin has the potential to prevent steroid-induced ONFH. METHODS All 18 male adult Wistar rats were divided equally into three groups: the steroid group, the gastrodin+steroid group, and the control group. Osteonecrosis was induced by low-dose lipopolysaccharide and subsequent high-dose methylprednisolone. Histomorphometric method was used to determine the incidence of osteonecrosis. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed to detect apoptotic index of osteocytes and osteoblasts. Real-time PCR and Western blotting were performed to detect mRNA and protein expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and Caspase-3. Fisher's exact probability test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Turkey's post hoc test were used to examine significant differences between groups. RESULTS The incidence of osteonecrosis in the gastrodin+steroid group (16.7%) was significantly lower than that in the steroid group (83.3%). According to TUNEL assay, the apoptotic indices in the steroid group, the gastrodin+steroid group, and the control group were 91.1%, 27.1%, and 5.4%, respectively, and the differences were significant between groups. Compared with the control group and the gastrodin+steroid group, the mRNA and protein expression levels of Bax and Caspase-3 were significantly higher in the steroid group, but the Bcl-2 mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly lower.

Interactions between humans and the reintroduced species are likely to occur post-reintroduction. Coexistence between humans and wildlife is adaptive and dynamic, in part requiring management of conflicts between humans and wildlife, or of conflicts between humans over wildlife management. We seek to learn from the experiences of steering group members in a Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) project in England and identify how governance of coexistence with reintroduced species may differ from the governance of coexistence with species that are already present in the landscape. Using a qualitative thematic analysis of an online survey, we identify a series of lessons in six key areas: (1) project governance, (2) stakeholder engagement, (3) research and monitoring programme, (4) strategy to manage arising conflicts, (5) public engagement, and (6) broad perspectives on reintroduction trials. We advocate for reflective evaluation as an essential component of reintroduction projects to enable knowledge-sharing from experiences, leading to improved practices in the future. Reflecting on our analysis, we identify and define ‘Renewed Coexistence’—a new term that draws on pre-existing coexistence knowledge but identifies the unique elements that relate to governing coexistence with reintroduced species.

This approach has the advantage of being independent from patient population testing and symptomatic disease courses. However, it is equally important to develop easily accessible and scalable tools which can highlight critical changes in infection rates and dynamics over time across different locations given the sequencing data from the wastewater. Here we provide the first analysis of variant dynamics in Germany using wastewater sequencing and present PiGx SARS-CoV-2, a bit-by-bit reproducible end-to-end pipeline with comprehensive reports. To our knowledge, this is the first pipeline that includes all steps from raw-data to shareable reports, additional taxonomic analysis, deconvolution and geospatial time series analysis. Using our pipeline on a dataset of wastewater samples, from different locations across Berlin, over the time period from February 2021 to June 2021, we could reconstruct the dynamic of the Variant of Concern (VoC) B.1.1.7 (alpha). Additionally, we detected the unique signature mutation M:T26767C for the VoC B.1.617.2 (delta) and its raise in early June. We also show that SARS-CoV-2 mutation load measured from wastewater sequencing is correlated with actual case numbers and it has potential to be used in a predictive manner. All in all, our study provides additional evidence that systematic wastewater analysis using sequencing and computational methods can be used for modeling the infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the results show that our tool can be used to tease out new mutations and to detect any emerging new lineages of concern before clinical detection.

Innovative use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe to perform TTE for such patients has been described; but reproducibility and correlation of the TTE measurements by this technique with those obtained by the standard supine TTE study are still unknown. METHODS: We enrolled 30 non-COVID-19 individuals, with a mean (SD) age 35 (10.9) years and 11 females, to study the agreement between the transthoracic measurements of the left ventricular (LV), left atrial (LA), aortic dimensions, and ejection fraction (EF) obtained in prone position using an external TEE probe versus the standard supine position using the conventional TTE probe. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between LV end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters, septal wall thickness, posterior wall thickness, and aortic root dimensions in the prone versus the supine positions, while the mean EF (60.3% vs 63.1%, P = .014) and mean LA dimensions (1.8 vs 1.9 cm/m2 , P < .001) were significantly lower in the prone position. The mean time of scans was significantly longer in the prone as compared to the supine position (12.5 vs 4.5 minutes, P < .001). All supine studies had good quality while in the prone position four studies were of poor quality, and one was nondiagnostic.

The spleen is greatly involved in the immune response, especially against capsulated bacteria. Splenectomy plays a fundamental role in the treatment of numerous pediatric hematologic disorders. Taking into account all the possible complications (especially infections) linked to this procedure, alternatives to total splenectomy have been sought. Partial splenectomy has been proposed as a treatment that allows the reduction of infectious risk.

We used generalized estimating equations and linear mixed models to explore factors associated with long-term mental health symptoms during COVID-19. During the five months, mental health symptoms remained consistently elevated (baseline 46.4%; follow-up 45.1%). Long-term depression, anxiety and insomnia were associated with several personal and work-related factors including quarantine (adjusted OR for any mental health symptoms 1.31, 95%CI 1.22–1.41, p < 0.001), increases in work burden after resuming work (1.77, 1.65–1.90, p < 0.001), occupational exposure risk to COVID-19 (1.26, 1.14–1.40, p < 0.001) and living in places severely affected by initial COVID-19 peak (1.21, 1.04–1.41, p = 0.01) or by a COVID-19 resurgence (1.38, 1.26–1.50, p < 0.001).

uzzb2gf3,,WHO,In the Crosshairs: RNA Viruses OR Complement?,,,,unk,"Complement, a part of the innate arm of the immune system, is integral to the frontline defense of the host against innumerable pathogens, which includes RNA viruses. Among the major groups of viruses, RNA viruses contribute significantly to the global mortality and morbidity index associated with viral infection. Despite multiple routes of entry adopted by these viruses, facing complement is inevitable. The initial interaction with complement and the nature of this interaction play an important role in determining host resistance versus susceptibility to the viral infection. Many RNA viruses are potent activators of complement, often resulting in virus neutralization. Yet, another facet of virus-induced activation is the exacerbation in pathogenesis contributing to the overall morbidity. The severity in disease and death associated with RNA virus infections shows a tip in the scale favoring viruses. Growing evidence suggest that like their DNA counterparts, RNA viruses have co-evolved to master ingenious strategies to remarkably restrict complement. Modulation of host genes involved in antiviral responses contributed prominently to the adoption of unique strategies to keep complement at bay, which included either down regulation of activation components (C3, C4) or up regulation of complement regulatory proteins. All this hints at a possible ""hijacking"" of the cross-talk mechanism of the host immune system. Enveloped RNA viruses have a selective advantage of not only modulating the host responses but also recruiting membrane-associated regulators of complement activation (RCAs). This review aims to highlight the significant progress in the understanding of RNA virus-complement interactions.",2020,"Kumar, Nisha Asok; Kunnakkadan, Umerali; Thomas, Sabu; Johnson, John Bernet",Front Immunol,,#1226976,,,,,221979164.0

Absent a vaccine, authorities have few other tools by which to mitigate further spread of the virus. This begs the question of how effective social policy really is at reducing new infections that, left alone, would likely overwhelm the existing hospitalization capacity of many states. We developed a mathematical model that captures correlations between state-level “social distancing” policies and infection kinetics for all U.S. states, and use it to illustrate the link between social policy decisions, disease dynamics, and an effective reproduction number that changes over time, for case studies of Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Washington states.

Die Ergebnisse der deutschen Teilstichprobe basieren auf den Antworten von 513 Fällen (Eltern-Kind-Dyaden). Die wichtigsten Ergebnisse sind im Folgenden zusammengefasst: Die Daten bestätigen die Erwartungen und die Ergebnisse anderer Studien, dass sich die Mediennutzung in der Zeit der Schulschließungen erhöht hat. Nach Selbsteinschätzung der befragten Kinder und Jugendlichen lag die durchschnittliche Mediennutzungsdauer bei 5,9 Stunden pro Tag. Mehr als die Hälfte ihrer täglichen Online-Zeit (3,3 Stunden) haben die befragten Kinder und Jugendlichen während der Zeit der Schulschließungen allerdings mit der Bearbeitung von Schulaufgaben verbracht. Die Ausweitung der Nutzungszeiten ist vor allem auf die verstärkte Kommunikation über Online-Medien zurückzuführen, sei es, um mit den Lehrern Kontakt zu halten oder sich mit Familienmitgliedern und Freund*innen auszutauschen. Auch andere Online-Aktivitäten wie Spielen, Spaß und Unterhaltung oder die Suche nach In-formationen haben in der Zeit der Schulschließungen zeitlich mehr Raum eingenommen, wobei sich dies am deutlichsten in der jüngsten Altersgruppe widerspiegelt. Im Schnitt fand der Unterricht neun Wochen lang über Online-Lehre bzw. als Mischform statt, wobei sich teils große Unterschiede hinsichtlich der Dauer dieser Lehrform zeigen. Auch hinsichtlich der Unterrichtsgestaltung und des Kontakts mit Lehrkräften zeichnen sich große Unterschiede ab. Im Großen und Ganzen sind die befragten Kinder und Jugendlichen gut mit dem Online-Unterricht zurechtgekommen. Inwiefern Kinder und Jugendliche sich in der Lage fühlten, das Online-Lernen zu bewältigen, hing unter anderem auch mit der Unterstützungsleistung der Eltern zusammen. Knapp ein Drittel der Eltern zeigt sich besorgt oder sehr besorgt, dass die Corona-Krise negative Auswirkungen auf die Bildung ihres Kindes haben könnte (z. B., dass sie im Schulstoff zurückfallen oder durch Prüfungen fallen). Ein Viertel der Kinder und Jugendlichen hatte während der Zeit der Schulschließungen Sorge, Schulaufgaben nicht bewältigen oder mit dem Lernstoff nicht mithalten zu können. 30 Prozent befürchteten, dass sie wegen des Online-Unterrichts schlechte Noten bekommen würden. Für den Fall einer erneuten Schulschließung wünschen sich Eltern zusätzliche Unterstützung von der Schule ihres Kindes, sowohl im Hinblick auf den Schulstoff, aber auch Angebote für gemeinschaftliches Lernen sowie Anregungen für außerschulische Aktivitäten, die die Kinder auch zu Hause durchführen können.",2021,"Lampert, Claudia Thiel Kira Güngör Begüm",,,#grc-747960,,,,https://doi.org/10.21241/ssoar.71712,234110569.0

CT findings associated with COVID-19 pneumonia from initial diagnosis until patient recovery. This study aimed to retrospectively analyze abnormal lung changes following initial computed tomography (CT) among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Yunnan, and to evaluate the effectiveness of a chest CT-based model for the diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS One hundred and nine patients with COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed with the positive new coronavirus nucleic acid antibody who exhibited abnormal findings on initial CT were retrospectively analyzed. Thereafter, changes in the number, distribution, shape, and density of the lesions were observed. Further, the epidemiological, clinical, and CT imaging findings (+/-) were correlated. Following univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for significant factors, and models were established to evaluate the diagnostic ability of CT for COVID-19. RESULTS Our results showed significant differences between patients with COVID-19 in epidemiological history (first, second, and third generation), clinical type (moderate, severe, and critical), and abnormal CT imaging characteristics (+/-) (P<0.05). Moreover, significant differences in abnormal CT imaging characteristics, including region, extent, and focus, were observed between the first generation and the other generations (P<0.05).

Meta-regression confirmed that this association was not influenced by age (p = 0.208), CD4 cell count (p = 0.353) or the presence of antiretroviral therapy (ART) (p = 0.647). Further subgroup analysis indicated that the association was only statistically significant in studies from Africa (OR = 1.13, p = 0.004) and the United States (OR = 1.30, p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Whilst all persons ought to receive a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, PLWH should be prioritised to minimise the risk of death because of COVID-19. The presence of HIV should be regarded as an important risk factor for future risk stratification of COVID-19.",2021-04-15,"Hariyanto, Timotius I.; Rosalind, Jane; Christian, Kevin; Kurniawan, Andree",South Afr J HIV Med,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/5532d8e5895d72224d153daf9a97827f76af4b54.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8063497.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33936793/; https://doi.org/10.4102/sajhivmed.v22i1.1220,233456349.0

Since the first report of COVID-19 on December 31, 2019, 179,111 cases were confirmed in 160 countries/regions with 7426 deaths as of March 17, 2020. However, there have been no vaccines approved in the world to date. In this study, we analyzed the biological characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, Pro330-Leu650 (SARS-CoV-2-SPL), using biostatistical methods. SARS-CoV-2-SPL possesses a receptor-binding region (RBD) and important B (Ser438-Gln506, Thr553-Glu583, Gly404-Aps427, Thr345-Ala352, and Lys529-Lys535) and T (9 CD4 and 11 CD8 T cell antigenic determinants) cell epitopes. High homology in this region between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV amounted to 87.7%, after taking the biological similarity of the amino acids into account and eliminating the receptor-binding motif (RBM). The overall topology indicated that the complete structure of SARS-CoV-2-SPL was with RBM as the head, and RBD as the trunk and the tail region. SARS-CoV-2-SPL was found to have the potential to elicit effective B and T cell responses.

Objective: To assess the health care activities in the ""peak"" of the pandemic during 3 months. Materials and Methods: we collected data from the electronic health record. Results: There were a total of 293 medical appointments from 131 patients (221 face-to-face), that decreased by 16.7% compared to the same period in 2019 (352 appointments). The medical appointments were scheduled to evaluate the continuity of systemic treatment or modifications (95 patients; 72.5%), follow-up (17; 12.9%), first-time consultation (12; 9.1%), and assess paraclinical studies (7; 5.3%).

Despite it is claimed to improve both quality of software and developers’ productivity, the research on the claimed effects of TDD has so far shown inconclusive results. Some researchers have ascribed these inconclusive results to the negative affective states that TDD would provoke. A previous (baseline) experiment has, therefore, studied the affective reactions of (novice) developers—i.e., 29 third-year undergraduates in Computer Science (CS)—when practicing TDD to implement software. To validate the results of the baseline experiment, we conducted a replicated experiment that studies the affective reactions of novice developers when applying TDD to develop software. Developers in the treatment group carried out a development task using TDD, while those in the control group used a non-TDD approach. To measure the affective reactions of developers, we used the Self-Assessment Manikin instrument complemented with a liking dimension. The most important differences between the baseline and replicated experiments are: (i) the kind of novice developers involved in the experiments—third-year vs. second-year undergraduates in CS from two different universities; and (ii) their number—29 vs. 59. The results of the replicated experiment do not show any difference in the affective reactions of novice developers. Instead, the results of the baseline experiment suggest that developers seem to like TDD less as compared to a non-TDD approach and that developers following TDD seem to like implementing code less than the other developers, while testing code seems to make them less happy.",2020-05-06,"Romano, Simone; Scanniello, Giuseppe; Baldassarre, Maria Teresa; Fucci, Davide; Caivano, Danilo",Agile Processes in Software Engineering and Extreme Programming,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ae43484654e5dd053b5df99e6e0a37eef86fe782.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7251620.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7251620/,

METHODS: Televisits were offered to patients scheduled for neurology appointments between March and July 2020 using the telephone, WhatsApp video, or Zoom calls based on patient accessibility. Visit outcomes were documented, and patient and neurologist satisfaction surveys were completed. RESULTS: Of 323 patients, 195 (60%) were reachable by telephone, 179 of these were alive, and 74% (133/179) of those alive agreed to a televisit. Stroke (30%), seizures (20%), and headache (16%) were the most common diagnoses seen via televisit. Most televisits (80%) were by telephone call, 14% by WhatsApp video call, and 6% by Zoom. Nearly one‐third (30%) of the patients were stable and discharged from the clinic, 32% only required medication refills, and 19% required an in‐person visit. Sixty patients (out of 85 reachable and 71% response rate) and 7 of 9 neurologists (78% response rate) completed satisfaction surveys. Neurologists reported greater assessment confidence with Zoom, but confidence was high for all modalities. Patients preferring televisits (75%, 45/60) noted reduced expense and time requirements, whereas those preferring in‐person visits (22%, 13/60) cited the desire for physical examinations. Overall, 98% of patients and 100% of neurologists were satisfied with televisits. INTERPRETATION: Teleneurology visits were acceptable and feasible for adults attending an outpatient neurology clinic in Zambia and their neurologists. They offer a promising supplement to in‐person visits in resource‐limited settings, even when video‐conference capabilities and electronic medical records are absent.

Given that most of the work under the SDGs only began inception between 2018 and 2019, there is still a long way to go before meaningful progress can be reported regarding SDG localization, with preliminary evidence showing that the hotel industry is likely to have made significant inroads when the SDGs lapse in 2030 if their efforts are not disturbed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

OBJECTIVE Indirect decompression via lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) can ameliorate central and foraminal lumbar stenosis. In severe central stenosis, additional posterior direct decompression is utilized. The aim of this review is to synthesize existing literature on these 2 techniques and identify significant differences in outcomes between isolated indirect decompression via LLIF and combined indirect decompression supplemented with direct posterior decompression. METHODS A database search algorithm was utilized to query MEDLINE, COCHRANE, and EMBASE to identify literature reporting adult decompression study groups that involved an oblique or lateral fusion approach through September 2020. Improvement in outcomes measures and complication rates were pooled and tested for significance. RESULTS A total of 110 publications were assessed with 15 studies meeting inclusion criteria, including 557 patients and 1008 levels. Mean age was 63.1 years with BMI of 27.5 kg/m2. For the combined indirect and direct decompression cohort, lumbar lordosis (LL) increased 133.9%, from 22.8o to 48.7o, while the indirect decompression cohort LL increased 8.9%, from 41.9o to 45.5o.

Factors impacting outcomes will inform triage and management algorithms. We proposed to conduct these clinical and genomic evaluations. Methods: We recorded demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes for 274 patients with COVID-19 in 6 states (CT, MA, ME, NH, RI, VT) from 4/8/20-9/16/20, and used STATA v16 for logistic regressions. Peak disease severity was defined from grade 1-5 as no O2 requirement, 1-3 liters (L) by nasal cannula (NC), 4-6 L NC, >6 L O2 or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, and mechanical ventilation. We generated 64 whole genomes from 3/31/20-5/11/20 using Illumina (238) and Nanopore (61) platforms and built a phylogenetic tree (Nextstrain). Results: Of 274 Veterans, 92.7% were male, 83.2% white, and mean age was 63 years (IQR: 51 to 74 years). Over a third resided in a long-term care facility, and most common comorbidities were coronary artery disease (27%), diabetes (25%), and tobacco use (23%). 11.7% of patients required O2 within 24 hours of admission, with 20.8% of all patients requiring O2 support above their baseline during the hospitalization. Overall, 28.8% were hospitalized, with the highest rates in people with COPD (50%), CAD (45.9%), and those over age 80 years (44.4%). The overall mortality rate was 10.6%, with the highest rates in people with dementia (33.3%), age >80 (28.9%), and those from LTC (23.9%). On multivariate regression, significant predictors of hospitalization were age (OR: 1.05) and Non-white race (OR: 2.39). Peak severity also varied by age (OR: 1.07) and O2 requirement on admission (OR: 45.7). Mortality was predicted by age (OR: 1.06), dementia (OR: 3.44), and O2 requirement on admission (OR: 6.74). Most of our samples were in the A (2.36%) and B (97.3%) lineages. One genome was part of the N.1 lineage. Notably, the majority of genomes (97%) are part of the B1 lineage, which is defined by a D614G substitution. Conclusions: Our study found that in an older cohort of Veterans from the six New England states with a high comorbidity burden, age was the single strongest predictor of hospitalization, peak severity, and mortality. Non-white Veterans were more likely to be hospitalized, and patients who required oxygen on admission were more likely to have severe disease and higher rates of mortality. Furthermore, patients with dementia were more likely to die. Multiple genomic variants of SARS-CoV-2 were distributed in patients in New England early in the COVID-19 era, mostly in the New York clade with a D614G mutation.",2021-04-30,"Lee, M.; Sallah, Y.

In this paper, we propose a model to study the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Ghana using fractional-derivatives. The fractional-derivative is defined in the Atangana Beleanu Caputo (ABC) sense. This model considers seven (7) classes namely; Susceptible individuals, Exposed, Asymptomatic population, Symptomatic, Vaccinated, Quarantined, and Recovered population. The equilibrium points, stability analysis, and the basic reproduction number of the model have been determined. The existence and uniqueness of the solution and Ulam Hyers stability are established. The model is tested using Ghana demographical and COVID-19 data. Further, two preventive control measures are incorporated into the model. The numerical analysis reveals the impact of the fractional-order derivative on the various classes of the disease model as one can get reliable information at any integer or non-integer value of the fractional operator. The results of the simulation predict the COVID-19 cases in Ghana. Analysis of the optimal control reveals social distancing leads to an increase in the susceptible population, whereas vaccination reduces the number of susceptible individuals. Both vaccination and social distancing lead to a decline in COVID-19 infections.

One possible method for increasing assay sensitivity for detecting changes in pain intensity is to increase the reliability of pain intensity assessment by increasing the number of intensity ratings obtained, and combining these ratings into composite scores. The current study performed secondary analyses from a published clinical trial to test this possibility. The reliability and assay sensitivity pain intensity scores made up of 1 to 9 24-hour pain intensity recall ratings were compared. Although the reliability of the outcome measures improved as the number of items increased, this increase in reliability was not associated with an increase in assay sensitivity. A single 24-hour recall rating was about as valid (sensitive) for detecting treatment effects as composite scores made up of 2 to 9 different ratings. If this finding replicates in other pain populations, it has significant implications for the design and conduct of pain clinical trials. Specifically, it suggests the possibility that assessment burden (and associated costs and problems related to missing data) might be greatly reduced by specifying a single recall rating as the primary outcome variable.

METHODS We conducted a multicenter cohort study of consecutive acute stroke patients scheduled to undergo endovascular therapy within 90 minutes after a baseline CT perfusion. Patients were classified as ""target mismatch"" if they had a small ischemic core and a large penumbra on their baseline CT perfusion. Reperfusion was defined as >50% reduction in critical hypoperfusion between the baseline CT perfusion and the 36-hour follow-up magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS Of the 201 patients enrolled, 190 patients with an adequate baseline CT perfusion study who underwent angiography were included (mean age = 66 years, median NIH Stroke Scale [NIHSS] = 16, median time from symptom onset to endovascular therapy = 5.2 hours). Rate of reperfusion was 89%. In patients with target mismatch (n = 131), reperfusion was associated with higher odds of favorable clinical response, defined as an improvement of ≥8 points on the NIHSS (83% vs 44%; p = 0.002, adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 6.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.1-20.9).

However, existing preparedness assessments focus primarily on public health systems or specific legislative frameworks, and do not measure other essential capacities that enable and support public health preparedness and response. METHODS: We developed an Epidemic Preparedness Index (EPI) to assess national-level preparedness. The EPI is global, covering 188 countries. It consists of five subindices measuring each country’s economic resources, public health communications, infrastructure, public health systems and institutional capacity. To evaluate the construct validity of the EPI, we tested its correlation with proxy measures for preparedness and response capacity, including the timeliness of outbreak detection and reporting, as well as vaccination rates during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. RESULTS: The most prepared countries were concentrated in Europe and North America, while the least prepared countries clustered in Central and West Africa and Southeast Asia. Better prepared countries were found to report infectious disease outbreaks more quickly and to have vaccinated a larger proportion of their population during the 2009 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The EPI measures a country’s capacity to detect and respond to infectious disease events. Existing tools, such as the Joint External Evaluation (JEE), have been designed to measure preparedness within a country over time. The EPI complements the JEE by providing a holistic view of preparedness and is constructed to support comparative risk assessment between countries.

AIMS: To assess the prevalence of APE in patients hospitalized for non‐critical COVID‐19 who presented clinical deterioration, and to investigate the association of clinical and biochemical variables with a confirmed diagnosis of APE in these subjects. METHODS: All consecutive patients admitted to the internal medicine department of a general hospital with a diagnosis of non‐critical COVID‐19, who performed a Computer Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) for respiratory deterioration in April 2020, were included in this retrospective cohort study. RESULTS: Study populations: 41 subjects, median(IRQ)age:71.7(63‐76)years, CPTA confirmed APE=8(19.51%,CI95%:8.82%‐34.87%). Among patients with and without APE, no significant differences were found with regards symptoms, comorbidities, treatment, Wells score and outcomes. The optimal cut‐off value of D‐dimer for predicting APE was 2454 ng/mL, sensitivity(CI95%):63(24‐91), specificity:73(54‐87), Positive Predictive Value:36(13‐65), Negative Predictive Value: 89(71‐98) and AUC:0.62(0.38‐0.85). The standard and age‐adjusted D‐dimer cut‐offs, and the Wells score >2 did not associate with confirmed APE, albeit a cut‐off value of D‐dimer=2454 ng/mL showed an RR:3.21;CI95%:0.92‐13.97;p=0.073. Heparin at anticoagulant doses was used in 70.73% of patients before performing CTPA. CONCLUSION: Among patients presenting pulmonary deterioration after hospitalization for non‐critical COVID‐19, the prevalence of APE is high. Traditional diagnostic tools to identify high APE pre‐test probability patients do not seem to be clinically useful. These results support the use of a high index of suspicion for performing CTPA to exclude or confirm APE as the most appropriate diagnostic approach in this clinical setting.

hqk0oczf,,WHO,‘Wherever You Are Whenever You Want’: Captivating And Encouraging Music Experiences When Symphony Orchestra Performances Are Provided Online,10.16995/olh.4679,,,unk,"This article examines how ideas about music and music listening are articulated and what listening practices are constructed when symphony orchestras provide concert performances through streaming services. This is achieved by paying attention to how listening situations connected to symphony orchestras’ digital performances are characterized, how the audience is positioned in relation to the performances and the involved musicians, and furthermore to how the music is represented in text, images and verbal statements. The empirical data comprises the streaming service platforms, and supporting materials, of two concert institutions, London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) and Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra (GSO), and was gathered during spring 2020, i.e. when concert halls were closed in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The article demonstrates how online listening practices are characterized as disconnected from constraints of time and space, and free for anyone to use, anytime and for almost any reason, yet also as strongly connected to temporal and spatial dimensions. Furthermore, it demonstrates how the listening practices connected to online symphonic performances are constructed in line with discourses on music as a health resource or as a mood enhancer and emotional regulator, but also in line with romantic aesthetic ideals. Even if the romantic aspects are less explicit, and thus could be perceived to be challenged, such ideals seem to remain uncontested as long as they are combined with more recent discourses on music. © 2021.

Although the antiinflammatory properties of fish oil may be beneficial during a chronic inflammatory illness, the same antiinflammatory properties can suppress the inflammatory responses necessary to combat acute viral infection. Given that (n-3) fatty acid-rich fish oil supplementation is on the rise and with the increasing threat of an influenza pandemic, we tested the effect of fish oil feeding for 2 wk on the immune response to influenza virus infection. Male C57BL/6 mice fed either a menhaden fish oil/corn oil diet (4 g fish oil:1 g corn oil, wt:wt at 5 g/100 g diet) or a control corn oil diet were infected with influenza A/PuertoRico/8/34 and analyzed for lung pathology and immune function. Although fish oil-fed mice had lower lung inflammation compared with controls, fish oil feeding also resulted in a 40% higher mortality rate, a 70% higher lung viral load at d 7 post infection, and a prolonged recovery period following infection. Although splenic natural killer (NK) cell activity was suppressed in fish oil-fed mice, lung NK activity was not affected. Additionally, lungs of infected fish oil-fed mice had significantly fewer CD8(+) T cells and decreased mRNA expression of macrophage inflammatory protein-1-α, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-6.

Therefore, it is necessary to establish the effectiveness of available vaccines as this group of patients was not represented in the randomized trials. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A total of 707 consecutive adult kidney transplant recipients in a single center in the United Kingdom were evaluated. 373 were confirmed to have received two doses of either the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or AZD1222 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) and subsequently had SARS-COV-2 antibody testing were included in the final analysis. Participants were excluded from the analysis if they had a previous history of SARS-COV-2 infection or were seropositive for SARS-COV-2 antibody pre-vaccination. Multivariate and propensity score analyses were performed to identify the predictors of antibody response to SARS-COV-2 vaccines. The primary outcome was seroconversion rates following two vaccine doses. RESULTS: Antibody responders were 56.8% (212/373) and non-responders 43.2% (161/373). Antibody response was associated with greater estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) rate [odds ratio (OR), for every 10 ml/min/1.73m(2) = 1.40 (1.19–1.66), P<0.001] whereas, non-response was associated with mycophenolic acid immunosuppression [OR, 0.02(0.01–0.11), p<0.001] and increasing age [OR per 10year increase, 0.61(0.48–0.78), p<0.001]. In the propensity-score analysis of four treatment variables (vaccine type, mycophenolic acid, corticosteroid, and triple immunosuppression), only mycophenolic acid was significantly associated with vaccine response [adjusted OR by PSA 0.17 (0.07–0.41): p<0.001]. 22 SARS-COV-2 infections were recorded in our cohort following vaccination. 17(77%) infections, with 3 deaths, occurred in the non-responder group. No death occurred in the responder group. CONCLUSION: Vaccine response in allograft recipients after two doses of SARS-COV-2 vaccine is poor compared to the general population.

HCWs are exposed to a number of occupational hazards and physically demanding work tasks. Musculoskeletal disorders, stress, exhaustion, high sick leave rates and a high probability of being granted a disability pension are common challenges. This qualitative study explored the views of HCWs on how working conditions affect their safety, health, and wellbeing. METHODS: A descriptive and explorative design was utilised using semi-structured individual interviews with eight HCWs from three home care units in a middle-sized Norwegian city. Interviews were conducted in the Norwegian language, audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim. The data was analysed by systematic text condensation. Key data quotes were translated into English by the authors. RESULTS: HCWs reported that meaningful work-related interactions and relationships contributed to their improved wellbeing. Challenging interactions, such as verbal violence by consumers, were deemed stressful. The unpredictable work conditions HCWs encounter in users’ homes contributed to their exposure to environmental hazards and unhealthy physical workloads. This was the case, although the employer promoted ergonomic work practices such as ergonomic body mechanics when mobilising and handling of clients, using safe patient handling equipment. HCWs perceived high level of individual responsibility for complying with company safety policies and practices, representing a health barrier for some. Organisational frameworks created unhealthy work conditions by shift work, time pressure and staffing challenges. Performing tasks in accordance with HCWs professional skills and identity was perceived as health-promoting. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that unpredictable working conditions at users’ home can adversely affect the safety, health, and wellbeing of HCWs. The interaction between the unpredictable environment at users’ homes, HCWs’ perceived high level of individual responsibility for complying with company safety policies and practices, and staffing challenges due to sickness-related absences upon the workplace creates tense work conditions with a negative influence on HCWs health.",2021-09-14,"Grasmo, Sunniva Grønoset; Liaset, Ingeborg Frostad; Redzovic, Skender Elez",BMC Health Serv Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/252f020d99d21ea38657a5494803b545c2996aba.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8438557.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-06941-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34521407/,237496527.0

We obtained time course data on multiple inflammatory mediators in the blood of blunt trauma patients. Using dynamic network analyses, we inferred a novel control architecture for systemic inflammation: a three-way switch comprising the chemokines MCP-1/CCL2, MIG/CXCL9, and IP-10/CXCL10. To test this hypothesis, we created a logical model comprising this putative architecture. This model predicted key qualitative features of systemic inflammation in patient sub-groups, as well as the different patterns of hospital discharge of moderately vs. severely injured patients.

Despite having a ridiculously huge, underserved population, very few African countries currently have any form of sustained and organized telemedicine practice, and even fewer have dedicated tele-neurology services. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has proved to be one of the most significant disruptors of vital sectors of human endeavor in modern times. In the healthcare sector, there is an increasing advocacy to deliver non-urgent care via telemedicine. This paper examined the current state of tele-neurology practice and infrastructural preparedness in sub-Saharan Africa. Currently, there is over 70% mobile phone penetration in most of the countries and virtually all of them have mobile internet services of different technologies and generations. Although the needed infrastructure is increasingly available, it should be improved upon.

However, measurements of and factors affecting bar displacement have not been reported. The objectives of this study were to develop a decision model to guide surgeons considering repeat treatment and to estimate optimal cut-off values to determine whether reoperation to correct bar displacement is warranted. METHODS From July 2011 to August 2013, ninety bars were inserted in 61 patients who underwent Nuss procedures for pectus excavatum. Group A did not need surgical intervention and Group B required reoperation for bar displacement. Bar position was measured as the distance from the posterior superior end of the sternal body to the upper border of the metal bar on lateral chest radiographs. The bar displacement index (BDI) was calculated using D0 - Dx / D0 x 100 (D0: bar position the day after surgery; Dx: minimal or maximal distance of bar position on the following postoperative days). The optimal cut-off values of BDI warranting reoperation were assessed on the basis of ROC curve analysis. RESULTS Of the 61 patients, 32 had single bars inserted whereas 29 had parallel bars inserted. There was a significant difference in age (14.0 ± 7.5 vs. 23.3 ± 12.0, p = 0.0062), preoperative Haller index (HI) (4.0 ± 1.1 vs. 5.0 ± 1.0, p = 0.033), and postoperative HI (2.7 ± 0.4 vs. 3.2 ± 0.5 p = 0.006) between the two groups. The optimal cut-off value of BDI was 8.7. CONCLUSIONS We developed a BDI model for surgeons considering performing reoperation after Nuss procedure. The optimal cut-off value of BDI was 8.7. This model may help surgeons to decide objectively whether corrective surgery should be performed.

A real-time RT-PCR assay was designed for the rapid screening of the Omicron variant, targeting characteristic mutations of the spike gene. The assay was used to test 737 sewage samples collected throughout Italy (19/21 Regions) between 11 November and 25 December 2021, with the aim of assessing the spread of the Omicron variant in the country. Positive samples were also tested with a real-time RT-PCR developed by the European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC), and through nested RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing. Overall, 115 samples tested positive for Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant. The first occurrence was detected on 7 December, in Veneto, North Italy. Later on, the variant spread extremely fast in three weeks, with prevalence of positive wastewater samples rising from 1.0% (1/104 samples) in the week 5–11 December, to 17.5% (25/143 samples) in the week 12–18, to 65.9% (89/135 samples) in the week 19–25, in line with the increase in cases of infection with the Omicron variant observed during December in Italy. Similarly, the number of Regions/Autonomous Provinces in which the variant was detected increased from one in the first week, to 11 in the second, and to 17 in the last one. The presence of the Omicron variant was confirmed by the JRC real-time RT-PCR in 79.1% (91/115) of the positive samples, and by Sanger sequencing in 66% (64/97) of PCR amplicons. In conclusion, we designed an RT-qPCR assay capable to detect the Omicron variant, which can be successfully used for the purpose of wastewater-based epidemiology.

These mitochondria-associated modes of cell death can lead to a variety of diseases. During cell growth, these modes of cell death are programmed, meaning that they can be induced or predicted. Mitochondria-based treatments have been shown to be effective in many trials. Therefore, mitochondria have great potential for the treatment of many diseases. In this review, we discuss how mitochondria are involved in modes of cell death, as well as basic research and the latest clinical progress in related fields.

Recent studies also show a bidirectional link between COVID-19 and mental health in that people with previous history of psychiatric illness have a higher risk for contracting COVID-19 and that COVID-19 patients display a variety of psychiatric illnesses. Risk factors and the response of the central nervous system to the virus show large overlaps with pathophysiological processes associated with Alzheimer's disease, delirium, post-operative cognitive dysfunction and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, all characterized by cognitive impairment. These similarities lead to the hypothesis that the neurological symptoms could arise from neuroinflammation and immune cell dysfunction both in the periphery as well as in the central nervous system and the assumption that long-term consequences of COVID-19 may lead to cognitive impairment in the well-being of the patient and thus in today's workforce, resulting in large loss of productivity.

METHODS: 25 survivors with confirmed severe COVID-19 were evaluated pulmonary function, HRCT, and health-related quality of life at seven months after discharge. The data during hospitalization were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Table1 summarized the characteristics of all 25 patients at seven months after discharge. Patients with abnormal CT at seven months (n = 10) had lower albumin level (29.5[26.5-31.2] vs 32.4[30.0-36.5], p = 0.016), higher CT peak scores (24[15-24] vs 13[9-18], p = 0.002), longer cumulative days of receiving glucocorticoids (12[10-14] vs 6[0-11], p = 0.013) compared with patients with normal or basically normal CT. Then survivors were categorized as patients with abnormal DLCO and DLCO/VA, abnormal DLCO but normal DLCO/VA, and normal DLCO and DLCO/VA (n = 7, 5, and 13 respectively). Abnormal DLCO and DLCO/VA group had lower serum IL-2R level (433[326-514] vs 1218[581-1754] vs 710[562-927], p = 0.005), IL-8 level (7.20[3.15-13.25] vs 33.40[23.25-121.35] vs 17.50[6.63-47.48], p = 0.018), TNF-α level (5.80[4.80-7.80] vs 10.10[8.60-11.90] vs 9.00[7.73-12.70], p = 0.010), but higher PCT level (0.08[0.04-0.10] vs 0.03[0.03-0.10] vs 0.03[0-0.04], p = 0.036) compared with other two groups.

We used an unbiased, genome-wide screening technology to determine the precise peptide sequences in SARS-CoV-2 that are recognized by the memory CD8+ T cells of COVID-19 patients. In total, we identified 3-8 epitopes for each of the 6 most prevalent human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types. These epitopes were broadly shared across patients and located in regions of the virus that are not subject to mutational variation. Notably, only 3 of the 29 shared epitopes were located in the spike protein, whereas most epitopes were located in ORF1ab or the nucleocapsid protein. We also found that CD8+ T cells generally do not cross-react with epitopes in the four seasonal coronaviruses that cause the common cold.

A total of 47 patients and 54 HCW were tested for COVID-19, by PCR-SARS-CoV-2. We report 11 cases of COVID-19 in hematological patients (including 2 post stem cell transplant) and 28 cases in HCW. Hematological cases were most severe or moderate and presented with several poor risk factors. Among HCW, COVID-19 were mostly mild, and all recovered without hospitalization. A cluster was observed among HCW. Despite a decrease in the number of procedures, the Transplant Program performed 8 autologous and 4 allogeneic SCT during the period, and 49 onco-hematological patients were admitted to continuing their treatments.

evnc3a4k,,WHO,Who Should Pay for COVID-19? The Inescapable Normativity of International Law,,,,unk,"Who should bear the costs of the COVID-19 pandemic? While multilateral institutions are beginning to consider how to distribute them, former U.S. President Trump and others have suggested suing China for damages. This ""lawsuit approach"" draws on a deep-seated conception of international law: States have a sovereign ""right to be left alone"";the only limit to this right is a correlative duty to avoid harming others. Those harmed can, then, sue for damages. In this view, who should pay for the costs of the pandemic (and how much) is not a normative question about justice, but rather one about factual causes and actuarial calculations. In this Article, we explore this lawsuit approach-not for its legal viability, but for its conceptual implications. We exhaustively and critically assess the doctrinal discussion on China's international liability for the pandemic while also pointing at deep theoretical implications that this novel crisis has for international law more broadly. Specifically, we make three novel claims. The first is that the arguments made using the lawsuit approach (based on the International Health Regulations and the no-harm principle), when meticulously analyzed under existing international norms, run into unexpected obstacles. On top of the jurisdictional and evidentiary hurdles noted by many, we argue that the lawsuit approach faces difficulties stemming from the lack of deep normative agreement in international law on how to deal with unprecedented challenges such as COVID-19. Our second claim draws on the first. Given the need to fill these normative voids, the lawsuit approach leads back to the global conversation about the allocation of losses that it carefully tries to avoid. This normative dependence cannot be spared by analogy with domestic law. Domestic law builds upon thick cultural understandings that fill empty legal concepts (such as ""harm"" or ""causation""), making them readily operative. International law, however, lacks an equivalent thick culture to fill these voids and therefore requires complex reconstructions of what states owe to one another. Our third claim further extends the foregoing reasoning. The lawsuit approach relies on international law as a means to achieve corrective justice while denying its implications for distributive justice. We argue that this is conceptually impossible. Allocating responsibility for the pandemic implicates inherently distributive concepts: To decide, an adjudicator would need to rely on a pretorian rule detailing how much effort and expense countries should dedicate to avoiding harm to other countries. That rule is conceptually distributive, independent of its content. The misfortunes derived from the pandemic are not conceptually different from the mis- fortunes of poverty, financial breakdowns, or climate change. Those going down the road of the lawsuit approach might be unpleasantly surprised by where that road leads them.",2021,"Guidi, Sebastián Maisley Nahuel",New York University Law Review,,#covidwho-1262832,,,,,235275175.0
tmo3yj1p,,WHO,Helping Québec Pharmacists Seize the Vaccination Service Opportunity: The Pharmacy Best Practice Workshops,,,,unk,"Vaccinations are a safe and effective way to protect against infectious diseases. The World Health Organization estimates vaccines have saved more lives than any other interventions and every year about two to three million deaths are averted worldwide through immunization. To improve vaccination coverage, pharmacists have been increasingly involved in immunization roles in their communities-as advocates, educators, and immunizers. Community pharmacy-based vaccination services have increased both in the number of immunization providers and the number of sites where patients can receive immunizations. In Canada, health care is under provincial legislation-and so, there are distinct differences in scope of pharmacist practice across the country. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020, in Québec, Canada's second-largest province, pharmacists did not have the authority to administer vaccines. To help prepare pharmacists in Québec to become immunizers, we developed and deployed a series of accredited workshops. In these facilitated workshops, pharmacists were able to share best practices that may lead to providing effective vaccination services, identify common competency gaps, discuss effective patient communication skills, and determine how to target the most vulnerable population groups. Participants were also asked to evaluate the workshop. Our results indicate the evaluation was very reliable in measuring participant satisfaction (Cronbach's &#945; = 0.94) and pharmacists commented that the workshops' learning outcomes exceeded their expectations, and the topics covered were relevant and applicable. The evaluation also asked participants to identify weaknesses of training, so future educational interventions can be planned accordingly.

The prior model for this motif contains two helices separated by a three-nucleotide bulge. Modifications to this model were suggested by SHAPE chemical probing of an entire HIV-1 RNA genome. Novel features of the SHAPE-directed model include alternate helical conformations and a larger, more complex structure. These structural elements also support the presence of a secondary frameshift site within the frameshift domain. Here, we use oligonucleotide-directed structure perturbation, probing in the presence of formamide, and in-virion experiments to examine these models. Our data support a model in which the frameshift domain is anchored by a stable helix outside the conventional domain. Less stable helices within the domain can switch from the SHAPE-predicted to the two-helix conformation. Translational frameshifting assays with frameshift domain mutants support a functional role for the interactions predicted by and specific to the SHAPE-directed model.

Pooling across comorbidity risk groups, odds of in-hospital mortality among Black patients were 75% lower than among American Indian and Alaska Native patients (odds ratio [OR], 0.25 [95% CI, 0.18-0.34]); odds of in-hospital death among White patients were 77% lower (OR, 0.23 [95% CI, 0.16-0.31]). Within comorbidity risk group analyses, Indigenous patients with the lowest risk (Elixhauser Comorbidity Index score ≤0) had an adjusted probability of in-hospital death of 0.10 compared with 0.03 for Black patients (OR, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.10-0.82]) and 0.04 for White patients (OR, 0.37 [95% CI, 0.13-1.07]). Probability of in-hospital death at the highest comorbidity risk levels (Elixhauser Comorbidity Index score ≥16) was 0.69 for American Indian and Alaska Native patients compared with 0.28 for Black patients (OR, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.08-0.32]) and 0.25 for White patients (OR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.07-0.27]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional study of US adults hospitalized with COVID-19 found that American Indian and Alaska Native patients had lower comorbidity risk scores than those observed among Black or White patients. Despite empirical associations between reduced comorbidity risk scores and reduced odds of inpatient mortality, American Indian and Alaska Native patients were significantly more likely to die in the hospital of COVID-19 than Black or White patients at every level of comorbidity risk. Alternative factors that may contribute to high mortality rates among Indigenous populations must be investigated.",2022-03-30,"Musshafen, Leslie A.; El-Sadek, Lamees; Lirette, Seth T.; Summers, Richard L.; Compretta, Caroline; Dobbs, Thomas E.",JAMA Netw Open,,,,,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8968465.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35353166/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.4822,247791645.0

OBJECTIVE: To review, summarize, compare, and evaluate the existing literature regarding the relationship between the ACLS and the functional and adaptive functional performance of adults living with mental illness. DATA SOURCES: Searches with no date limits were conducted in the CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ProQuest, and OTseeker databases. Study Selection and Data Collection: A five-stage scoping review methodology was used to examine peer-reviewed English-language literature reporting on the relationship between ACLS scores and functional and adaptive functional performance of adults with mental illness. Information from 15 studies was charted, collated, and numerically and thematically summarized. FINDINGS: A positive relationship between ACLS scores and in-the-moment performance was consistently reported. The relationship of ACLS scores to community living performance was less consistent. Methods of assessing performance, complexity of tasks assessed, and timing of assessments affected relationships with cognition as measured by ACLS. Gaps in the literature were identified. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings raise questions about how, why, and when occupational therapists use the ACLS. Increased examination is needed of what aspects of performance and functional cognition reliably determine people's ability to live successfully in the community.

Air quality data for 100 days recorded at 193 stations throughout India were analyzed between 25th March to 17th May 2020. A nationwide online survey was conducted to obtain public perceptions of air quality improvement (n = 1750). On average, approximately 40% improvement in the air quality index was observed, contributed by a reduction in 40% of PM(10), 44% of PM(2.5), 51% of NO(2) and 21% of SO(2). There was a significant difference between the levels of all the pollutants before and after the lockdown (p < 0.05), except ozone. The correlation between PM(10) and PM(2.5) with ozone was significant after the lockdown period, indicating that a significant portion of the particulates present in the atmosphere after the lockdown period is secondary. The values of PM(2.5)/PM(10) were found to be >0.5 in North East states and this observation points to the long-distance transport of PM(2.5) from other places. The survey for public perception showed that 60% of the respondents perceived improvement in air quality. Household emissions were perceived to be a significant source of pollution after the lockdown. An odds ratio (OR) of 17 (95%, CI: 6.42, 47.04) indicated a very high dependence of perception on actual air quality. OR between air quality and health improvement was 5.2 (95%, CI: 2.69, 10.01), indicating significant health improvement due to air quality improvement.

This study examines the indirect impact of the pandemic on a population of critically ill children in the United States. RESEARCH QUESTION: Were there significantly fewer critically ill children admitted to PICUs during the second quarter of 2020, and were there significant changes in the types of diseases admitted? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study used the Virtual Pediatric Systems database. Participants were 160,295 children admitted to the PICU at 77 sites in the United States during quarters 1 (Q1) and 2 (Q2) of 2017 to 2019 (pre-COVID-19) and 2020 (COVID-19). RESULTS: The average number of admissions was similar between pre-COVID-19 Q1 and COVID-19 Q1 but decreased by 32% from pre-COVID-19 Q2 to COVID-19 Q2 (20,157 to 13,627 admissions per quarter). The largest decreases were in respiratory conditions, including asthma (1,327 subjects in pre-COVID-19 Q2 (6.6% of patients) vs 241 subjects in COVID-19 Q2 (1.8%; P < .001) and bronchiolitis (1,299 [6.5%] vs 121 [0.9%]; P < .001). The percentage of trauma admissions increased, although the raw number of trauma admissions decreased. Admissions for diabetes mellitus and poisoning/ingestion also increased.

Our hypothesis for this study is that Hispanic or economically disadvantaged patients would represent a larger percentage of missed appointments and report more barriers to receiving care during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey utilizing a modified version of the Barriers to Care Questionnaire was administered via telephone to no-show patients, and median income by zip code was collected. Chi-squared, logistic regression, and Student’s t-tests were used to investigate any differences in those who did and did not keep their appointments as well as any differences in mean questionnaire scores. RESULTS: No-show patients were more likely to be Hispanic than not (OR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.3, 3.9, P = .002) and to live in a zip code that had a median income less than 200% of the federal poverty level (OR 1.7, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.4, P = .004). Respondents with a high school degree tended to report more barriers to care compared to those with less education. CONCLUSION: In our study, we identified ethnic, financial, and logistic concerns that may contribute to patients failing to keep their appointments with the otolaryngology clinic.

Yet, the rapidly evolving nature of these events poses significant challenges for guidance development and dissemination strategies predicated on well-understood concepts and clearly defined access and distribution pathways. Taxonomies are an important but underutilized tool for guidance authoring, dissemination and updating in such dynamic scenarios. OBJECTIVE: To design a rapid, semi-automated method for sampling and developing a PH guidance taxonomy using widely available Web crawling tools and streamlined manual content analysis. METHODS: Iterative samples of guidance documents were taken from four state PH agency websites, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization. Documents were used to derive and refine a preliminary taxonomy of COVID-19 PH guidance via content analysis. RESULTS: Eight iterations of guidance document sampling and taxonomy revisions were performed, with a final corpus of 226 documents. The preliminary taxonomy contains 110 branches distributed between three major domains: stakeholders (24 branches), settings (25 branches) and topics (61 branches). Thematic saturation measures indicated rapid saturation (≤5% change) for the domains of “stakeholders” and “settings”, and “topic”-related branches for clinical decision-making. Branches related to business reopening and economic consequences remained dynamic throughout sampling iterations. CONCLUSION: The PH guidance taxonomy can support public health agencies by aligning guidance development with curation and indexing strategies; supporting targeted dissemination; increasing the speed of updates; and enhancing public-facing guidance repositories and information retrieval tools.

Social distancing and isolation measures have presented challenges to students’ mental health. mHealth apps and wearable sensors may help monitor students at risk of COVID-19 and support their mental well-being. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to monitor students at risk of COVID-19 by using a wearable sensor and a smartphone-based survey. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study on undergraduate and graduate students at a public university in the Midwest United States. Students were instructed to download the Fitbit, Social Rhythms, and Roadmap 2.0 apps onto their personal smartphone devices (Android or iOS). Subjects consented to provide up to 10 saliva samples during the study period. Surveys were administered through the Roadmap 2.0 app at five timepoints: at baseline, 1 month later, 2 months later, 3 months later, and at study completion. The surveys gathered information regarding demographics, COVID-19 diagnoses and symptoms, and mental health resilience, with the aim of documenting the impact of COVID-19 on the college student population. RESULTS: This study enrolled 2158 college students between September 2020 and January 2021. Subjects are currently being followed-up for 1 academic year. Data collection and analysis are currently underway. CONCLUSIONS: This study examined student health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and assessed the feasibility of using a wearable sensor and a survey in a college student population, which may inform the role of our mHealth tools in assessing student health and well-being. Finally, using data derived from a wearable sensor, biospecimen collection, and self-reported COVID-19 diagnosis, our results may provide key data toward the development of a model for the early prediction and detection of COVID-19.

However, the cause of dysphagia development by halo-vest fixation is not yet clear. We therefore investigated the incidence of dysphagia and cervical alignment as well as clinical data from medical charts in patients treated with a halo-vest brace. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed clinical data from the medical charts of 49 patients who had undergone halo-vest fixation. Occipito (O)-C2 angle, C2-C6 angle, and pharyngeal inlet angle were assessed by lateral plain X-rays of the cervical spine. The impacts of these parameters on incidence and severity of dysphagia were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirteen patients (32%) suffered from dysphagia during halo-vest fixation, and age and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay were greater in the dysphagia group (p = 0.044 and 0.013, respectively) than in those who did not develop dysphagia. O-C2 angle was smaller in the dysphagia group (p = 0.016). After multivariate logistic analysis, body mass index, ICU stay, and O-C2 angle remained as independent risk factors related to incidence of dysphagia. Spearman rank correlation showed a negative correlation between ICU stay and Food Intake Level Scale (FILS) (p = 0.026), and a positive correlation between O-C2 angle and FILS (p = 0.008).

RESULTS Likelihood of developing disease increased as the ELISA value for bovine coronavirus (BCV) antigen detectable in feces increased (odds ratio [OR] = 2.94 for each 0.100 increase in BCV antigen ELISA value). Pregnant cattle were less likely to develop WD, compared with nonpregnant herdmates. Cows with high acute BCV antibody titers that seroresponded had greater odds of developing disease, compared with seroresponding cows with low acute titers. However, among those cows that did not serorespond, high acute antibody titers were associated with lower odds of developing the disease. CONCLUSION In herds affected by WD, ill cows were more likely to shed detectable amounts of BCV antigen in their feces, and pregnancy appeared to protect cattle from the disease. The measured interaction between BCV seroresponse and acute BCV antibody titer may be evidence of an immunopathologic condition, but could also have been attributable to dynamics of the ELISA or study design. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Factors that explained a cow's risk for illness within WD-affected herds may have been surrogate measures for that cow's nonspecific and BCV-specific immune profile.",1998,"Smith, D R; Fedorka-Cray, P J; Mohan, R; Brock, K V; Wittum, T E; Morley, P S; Hoblet, K H; Saif, L J",American journal of veterinary research,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9706202/,76886.0

The purpose of this retrospective matched cohort study is to evaluate the effect of flow diversion on the patency of the ophthalmic artery when treating ophthalmic artery aneurysms. METHODS A retrospective review of our prospectively collected institutional database identified 19 ophthalmic artery aneurysms treated with a PED. These were matched according to aneurysm diameter in a 1:2 fashion to ophthalmic artery aneurysms treated via coil embolization, although it is important to note that there was a statistically significance difference in the neck diameter between the two groups (p=0.045). Clinical and angiographic outcomes were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS On follow-up angiography, decreased flow through the ophthalmic artery was observed in 26% of the PED cohort and 0% of the coil embolization cohort (p=0.003). No ophthalmologic complications were noted in either cohort. Complete occlusion at 12 months was more common following PED treatment than coil embolization (74% vs 47%; p=0.089), although lower than reported in previous trials. This may be due to inflow into the ophthalmic artery keeping the aneurysm patent. Retreatments were more common following coil embolization than PED (24% vs 11%), but this was not significant (p=0.304). Permanent morbidity rates were not significantly different between the PED (11%) and coil embolization (3%) cohorts (p=0.255). CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that ophthalmic artery aneurysms may be adequately and safely treated with either the PED or coil embolization.

In small intestinal mucosa, ACE2 mRNA expression appears to increase with age and to display higher levels in patients taking ACE-inhibitors (ACE-I). There, ACE2 protein heterodimerizes with the neutral amino acid transporter Broad neutral Amino acid Transporter 1 (B0AT1) (SLC6A19) or the imino acid transporter Sodium-dependent Imino Transporter 1 (SIT1) (SLC6A20), associations that are required for the surface expression of these transport proteins. These heterodimers can form quaternary structures able to function as binding sites for SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins. The heterodimerization of the carboxypeptidase ACE2 with B0AT1 is suggested to favor the direct supply of substrate amino acids to the transporter, but whether this association impacts the ability of ACE2 to mediate viral infection is not known. B0AT1 mutations cause Hartnup disorder, a condition characterized by neutral aminoaciduria and, in some cases, pellagra-like symptoms, such as photosensitive rash, diarrhea, and cerebellar ataxia. Correspondingly, the lack of ACE2 and the concurrent absence of B0AT1 expression in small intestine causes a decrease in l-tryptophan absorption, niacin deficiency, decreased intestinal antimicrobial peptide production, and increased susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in mice. Thus, the abundant expression of ACE2 in small intestine and its association with amino acid transporters appears to play a crucial role for the digestion of peptides and the absorption of amino acids and, thereby, for the maintenance of structural and functional gut integrity.",2020-11-13,"Camargo, Simone M R; Vuille-Dit-Bille, Raphael N; Meier, Chantal F; Verrey, François",Clinical science,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1042/cs20200477; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33140827/,226243538.0

CT of the chest can verify the infection in patients with clinical symptoms and a negative test result accelerating treatment and actions to prevent further contagion. However, CT employs ionizing radiation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate protocol settings, associated radiation exposure, image quality and diagnostic performance of a low-dose CT protocol in a university hospital setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS Chest-CT examinations were performed on a single scanner (Somatom Definition Edge, Siemens Healthineers, Germany) in 105 symptomatic patients (60 male, 45 female). Images were evaluated with regard to protocol parameters, image quality, radiation exposure and diagnostic accuracy. Serial RT-PCR served as the standard of reference. Based on this reference standard sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of CT with 95% confidence interval were calculated. RESULTS The mean effective dose was 1.3 ± 0.4 mSv (0.7 - 2.9 mSv) for the patient cohort (mean age 66.6 ± 16.7 years (19-94 years), mean BMI 26.6 ± 5.3 kg/m² (16-46 kg/m²)). A sensitivity of 100 [95% CI: 82-100]%, a specificity of 78 [95% CI: 68-86]%, a positive predictive value of 50 [95% CI: 33-67]% and a negative predictive value of 100 [95% CI: 95-100]% were obtained. No COVID-19 diagnoses were missed by CT. Image noise did not strongly correlate with BMI or patient diameter and was rated as average. CONCLUSIONS We presented a robust imaging procedure with a chest CT protocol for confident diagnosis of COVID-19.

To shed light on ambivalence towards robots, we conducted a mixed-methods experiment with N = 163 German university students that investigated the influence of robot autonomy on robot-related attitudes. With technological progress, robots become increasingly autonomous. We hypothesized that high levels of robot autonomy would increase both positive and negative robot-related evaluations, resulting in more attitudinal ambivalence. We experimentally manipulated robot autonomy through text vignettes and assessed objective ambivalence (i.e., the amount of reported conflicting thoughts and feelings) and subjective ambivalence (i.e., self-reported experienced conflict) towards the robot ‘VIVA’ using qualitative and quantitative measures. Autonomy did not impact objective ambivalence. However, subjective ambivalence was higher towards the robot high versus low in autonomy. Interestingly, this effect turned non-significant when controlling for individual differences in technology commitment. Qualitative results were categorized by two independent raters into assets (e.g., assistance, companionship) and risks (e.g., privacy/data security, social isolation). Taken together, the present research demonstrated that attitudes towards robots are indeed ambivalent and that this ambivalence might influence behavioral intentions towards robots. Moreover, the findings highlight the important role of technology commitment. Finally, qualitative results shed light on potential users’ concerns and aspirations.

Whilst more could undoubtedly have been done, it seems that the UK Government's actions to avoid Type I errors arising from the pandemic may have caused Type II errors. More pertinently, it is almost impossible for the UK Government to lift these protections in a neutral way – if all are uniformly lifted too soon, then this will result in Type I errors;if all are uniformly lifted too late, then this will result in Type II errors. It is impossible and undesirable to decide when to lift protections on a case-by-case basis, and any attempt to selectively lift protections results in the UK Government deciding which sectors have advantages post-COVID-19 and which do not.

OBJECTIVES: We aim to provide early predictions of individual patients' intensive care unit length of stay, which might improve resource allocation and patient care during the on-going pandemic. METHODS: We developed a new semiparametric distributional index model depending on covariates which are available within 24h after intensive care unit admission. The model was trained on a large cohort of acute respiratory distress syndrome patients out of the Minimal Dataset of the Swiss Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Then, we predict individual length of stay of patients in the RISC-19-ICU registry. MEASUREMENTS: The RISC-19-ICU Investigators for Switzerland collected data of 557 critically ill patients with COVID-19. MAIN RESULTS: The model gives probabilistically and marginally calibrated predictions which are more informative than the empirical length of stay distribution of the training data. However, marginal calibration was worse after approximately 20 days in the whole cohort and in different subgroups. Long staying COVID-19 patients have shorter length of stay than regular acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. We found differences in LoS with respect to age categories and gender but not in regions of Switzerland with different stress of intensive care unit resources. CONCLUSION: A new probabilistic model permits calibrated and informative probabilistic prediction of LoS of individual patients with COVID-19. Long staying patients could be discovered early.

BACKGROUND: Mental health issues easily occurred among the frontline medical workers of a major epidemic. However, the stressors and psychological adjustments experienced by nurses have not been well described. This is crucial to improving clinical quality and nursing safety and ensuring nurses’ physical and psychological health. METHODS: We performed a cross‐sectional prospective study using the Self Reporting Questionnaire‐20, stressor and self‐adjustment questionnaire administered to frontline nurses in Wuhan at two time points: after they had worked in isolation wards for 7‐10 days (T(1)) and 2 months (T(2)). This paper complies with the STROBE reporting guideline for cross‐sectional studies. RESULTS: T(1) has 92 respondents and T(2) has 86. The positive rates of mental health problems were 26.09% and 9.30%, respectively, showing significantly different in the two periods. The main factors influenced mental health were self‐perceived stress and only child status. The most common stressors were: a large infected population, high infectivity; concerned about family’s health status; high mortality if not treated in time (T(1)); and long duration of the epidemic, separate from family for a long time (T(2)). In terms of self‐adjustment, 97.83%(T(1))/88.04%(T(2)) of nurses thought it was necessary, but 9(T(1)) /5(T(2)) chose to avoid addressing it, and 8(T(1)) /5(T(2)) utilized a professional psychological counseling hotline.

The COVID pandemic did not cause this, but because of this existential crisis and Climate change, the development of virtual worlds is speeding up. Their role in society is changing, and they are becoming just as important as real-world spaces. Still, due to their digital nature, they are inherently ephemeral, they only exist for a short time in software and hardware. Then, they are simply lost to the ether. These worlds and the experiences of the users within them needs to be preserved. For digital preservation of these virtual worlds to succeed, a new approach is necessary, based not on preserving the world’s data but on the players’ experiences within. A user-centric approach to the digital preservation of our experiences in Virtual Worlds virtual reality experiences is required. This can be achieved by extending our digital rights to include our right to replay. When codifying the right to allow for replaying experiences within virtual worlds, it can be argued that this action is burdening the companies who create those virtual worlds with undue responsibilities. This paper outlines how such a burden is trivial given modern-day game engines. To demonstrate this fact, an open-source library was developed to record generic objects within a Virtual World. This approach differs from others that approach treating the virtual world as a deterministic environment. The system in this paper records an object position and interactions within a world instead of just the raw inputs that most replay systems use. This article aims to discuss how future technology generating these worlds should target replays systems as a digital preservation method. Other more laborious processes will not be achieved even if they are enshrined into law. This approach hopes to offer to balance the burden between user and producer of virtual worlds. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.",2022,"Sayarh, J.

This paper focuses on a review of the available literature on the production of filaments for 3D printers from recycled polymers as the alternative to present approach of central selective collection of plastics. The possibility of recycling of basic thermoplastic materials and the impact of processing on their physicochemical and mechanical properties were verified (Lanzotti et al. 2019). In addition, commercially available filaments produced from recycled materials and devices which allow self-production of filaments to 3D printing from plastic waste were reviewed.",2020-09-04,"Mikula, Katarzyna; Skrzypczak, Dawid; Izydorczyk, Grzegorz; Warchoł, Jolanta; Moustakas, Konstantinos; Chojnacka, Katarzyna; Witek-Krowiak, Anna",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/269309072c9a2f4e0bf223daff122c5fea1acab5.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7473699.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888147/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-10657-8,221495158.0

The authors utilized flow cytometry to analyze circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Both patient cohorts maintained B and T cell phenotypes consistent with activation and cellular exhaustion throughout the first two months of infection. Additionally, follow-up samples from the non-hospitalized patient cohort showed that activation markers and cellular exhaustion increased over time. These findings illustrate the persistent nature of the adaptive immune system changes that have been noted in COVID-19 and suggest longer term effects that may shape the maintenance of immunity to SARS-CoV-2.",2021,"Mudd, Philip A; Remy, Kenneth E",J. clin. invest,,#890007,,,,,225072863.0

Additionally, the output of the ADRIANA can be used by healthcare administration to predict peak demand time for resources needed to treat infected individuals. ABM is suited for our research experiment, but to prevent the computational constraints of using ABM-based framework for this research, we develop an SEIR compartmental model, a discrete event simulator, and an optimized surrogate model to form a system named ADRIANA. We also ensure that the surrogate's findings are accurate enough to provide optimal solutions. We use the Genetic Algorithm (GA) for the optimization by estimating the optimal hyperparameter configuration for the surrogate.

As the major sensor of UPR in eukaryotes, IRE1, in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, catalyzes the unconventional splicing of HAC1 in yeast, bZIP60 in plants and XBP1 in metazoans. Recent studies suggest that IRE1p and HAC1 mRNA, the only UPR pathway found in yeast, evolves as a cognate system responsible for the robust UPR induction. However, the functional connectivity of IRE1 and its splicing target in multicellular eukaryotes as well as the degree of conservation of IRE1 downstream signaling effectors across eukaryotes remains to be established. Here, we report that IRE1 and its substrate bZIP60 function as a strictly cognate enzyme-substrate pair to control viral pathogenesis in plants. Moreover, we show that the S1P/S2P-bZIP17/bZIP28 pathway, the other known branch of UPR in plants, does not play a detectable role in virus infection, demonstrating the distinct function of the IRE1-bZIP60 pathway in plants. Furthermore, we provide evidence that bZIP60 and HAC1, products of the enzyme-substrate duet, rather than IRE1, are functionally replaceable to cope with ER stress in yeast. Taken together, we conclude that the downstream signaling of the IRE1-mediated splicing is evolutionarily conserved in yeast and plants, and that the IRE1-bZIP60 UPR pathway not only confers overlapping functions with the other UPR branch in fundamental biology but also may exert a unique role in certain biological processes such as virus-plant interactions.",2015-04-15,"Zhang, Lingrui; Chen, Hui; Brandizzi, Federica; Verchot, Jeanmarie; Wang, Aiming",PLoS Genet,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/886c69ba9b7fb6441b3dc9c06d77abf30e3a0703.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4398384.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1005164; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25875739/,1528951.0

They are classified into families based on molecular size like HSP27, 40, 70 and 90 etc, and many of them act as cellular chaperones that regulate protein folding and determine the fate of mis-folded or unfolded proteins. Studies have also shown multiple other functions of these proteins such as in cell signalling, transcription and immune response. Deregulation of these proteins leads to devastating consequences, such as cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and other life threatening diseases suggesting their potential importance in life processes. HSPs exist in multiple isoforms, and their biochemical and functional characterization still remains a subject of active investigation. In case of viral infections, several HSP isoforms have been documented to play important roles with few showing pro-viral activity whereas others seem to have an anti-viral role. Earlier studies have demonstrated that HSP40 plays a pro-viral role whereas HSP70 inhibits HIV-1 replication; however, clear isoform-specific functional roles remain to be established. A detailed functional characterization of all the HSP isoforms will uncover their role in cellular homeostasis and also may highlight some of them as potential targets for therapeutic strategies against various viral infections.

Anthropometric and physical fitness were assessed with the aim to relate possible associations between these characteristics and the workload changes in the pre- and post-lockdown periods. During the lockdown, players carried out an 8-week guided self-training. There was a general decrement in the players’ physical workload demands in competition, and the parameters related to high-intensity actions as accelerations and decelerations (-8.96% [ES: 0.64] and -11.04% [ES: 0.77] respectively;p < .05), Ind HSR (-35.57% [ES: 0.92];p = .002), HMLD (-8.58% [ES: 0.66];p = .016), PLOAD (-7.03% [ES: 0.54];p = .047) and Vmax (-3.80% [ES: 0.65];p = .016) can be highlighted.

OBJECTIVE: To assess risk of experiences of sexual violence among California LGBQA+ adults during adolescence and young adulthood. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study analyzed data from Cal-VEX 2020, a state-representative survey of California residents aged 18 years and older, to assess associations between LGBQA+ identification and types of SV experienced in adolescence (ages 13-17 years) and young adulthood (ages 18-24 years) using gender-stratified adjusted logistic regression. Forms of SV included verbal, cyber, and coercion or physically aggressive sexual harassment; homophobic or transphobic slurs; and forced sex. EXPOSURE: Sexual identity. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The outcome of interest was experiences with any 5 forms of sexual violence (verbal sexual harassment, homophobic or transphobic slurs, cyber sexual harassment, sexual coercion or physically aggressive sexual harassment, and forced sex) during adolescence or young adulthood. RESULTS: A total of 2102 contacted individuals (response rate, 26.2%) completed the Cal-VEX survey and were included in these analyses. Among these, the mean (SD) age was 46.6 (17.7) years, 1149 identified as female, 953 identified as male, and 214 respondents (9.6%) identified as LGBQA+. Compared with heterosexual individuals, LGBQA+ individuals had significantly higher odds of having experienced homophobic or transphobic slurs (women: AOR, 14.65; 95% CI, 5.14-41.77; men: AOR, 14.17; 95% CI, 6.96-28.86) and forced sex (women: AOR, 5.35; 95% CI, 2.74-10.43; men: AOR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.01-7.10) in adolescence. LGBQA+ women also had higher odds of having experienced verbal and coercion or physically aggressive sexual harassment in adolescence (AOR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.30-4.19). In young adulthood, LGBQA+ individuals also had higher odds of having experienced homophobic or transphobic slurs (women: AOR, 18.58; 95% CI, 7.12-48.49; men: AOR, 16.73; 95% CI, 8.26-33.92) in young adulthood. LGBQA+ men also had higher odds of having experienced homophobic or transphobic slurs (AOR, 16.73; 95% CI, 8.26-33.92); verbal (AOR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.44-7.53), cyber (AOR, 6.32; 95% CI, 1.50-26.52), and coercion or physically aggressive (AOR, 5.54; 95% CI, 2.08-14) sexual harassment; and forced sex (AOR, 21.26; 95% CI, 5.63-80.35) in young adulthood. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This survey study found that adult LGBQA+ individuals were at increased risk for having experienced SV across the continuum during adolescence and young adulthood, consistent with prior research.

Due to minimal microbial components, subunit (peptide-based) vaccines have demonstrated improved efficacies in stimulating immunogenic responses by host B- and T-cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Integrative immunoinformatics algorithms were used to determine linear and discontinuous B-cell epitopes from the S-glycoprotein sequence. End-point selection of the most potential B-cell epitope was based on highly essential physicochemical attributes. NetCTL-I and NetMHC-II algorithms were used to predict probable MHC-I and II T-cell epitopes for globally frequent HLA-A*O2:01, HLA-B*35:01, HLA-B*51:01 and HLA-DRB1*15:02 molecules. Highly probable T-cell epitopes were selected based on their high propensities for C-terminal cleavage, transport protein (TAP) processing and MHC-I/II binding. RESULTS: Preferential epitope binding sites were further identified on the HLA molecules using a blind peptide-docking method. Phylogenetic analysis revealed close relativity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S-protein. LALHRSYLTPGDSSSGWTAGAA(242→263) was the most probable B-cell epitope with optimal physicochemical attributes. MHC-I antigenic presentation pathway was highly favourable for YLQPRTFLL(269-277) (HLA-A*02:01), LPPAYTNSF(24-32) (HLA-B*35:01) and IPTNFTISV7(14-721) (HLA-B*51:01). Also, LTDEMIAQYTSALLA(865-881) exhibited the highest binding affinity to HLA-DR B1*15:01 with core interactions mediated by IAQYTSALL(870-878). COVID-19 YLQPRTFLL(269-277) was preferentially bound to a previously undefined site on HLA-A*02:01 suggestive of a novel site for MHC-I-mediated T-cell stimulation.

Personal protective equipment can reduce the risk. However, healthcare workers must be trained for the proper use of personal protective equipment to decrease exposure risk. This study aimed to investigate whether videos available on YouTube, presenting procedures of donning and doffing personal protective equipment, can be a useful learning resource for healthcare workers. Methods A search of YouTube was conducted using the keywords “Covid-19, personal protective equipment, donning, doffing”. Two investigators reviewed each video and collected the basic video information. Total videos were assessed independently as educationally useful and non-useful categories using a valid tool. The relationship of each video's usefulness with viewers’ preferences and the upload source were analyzed. Results A total of 300 videos were assessed;66 (22%) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Total video scores of educationally useful videos were higher than non-useful ones;the differences were significant. Healthcare/government agencies and hospitals mostly created educationally useful videos, e-learning platforms, and individuals mainly created non-useful videos. Significant correlations were observed between the video's usefulness and the total view and views per day. Conclusions During a pandemic, YouTube might be a resource for learning donning and doffing of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers if an appropriate selection process applied for determining educationally useful videos.",2022,"Kozanhan, Betul Tutar Mahmut Sami Arslan Derya",Enfermedades infecciosas y microbiologia clinica (English ed.),,#covidwho-1842901,,,,,229947977.0

OBJECTIVE To identify patients with muscle symptoms confirmed by statin rechallenge and compare lipid-lowering efficacy for 2 nonstatin therapies, ezetimibe and evolocumab. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Two-stage randomized clinical trial including 511 adult patients with uncontrolled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and history of intolerance to 2 or more statins enrolled in 2013 and 2014 globally. Phase A used a 24-week crossover procedure with atorvastatin or placebo to identify patients having symptoms only with atorvastatin but not placebo. In phase B, after a 2-week washout, patients were randomized to ezetimibe or evolocumab for 24 weeks. INTERVENTIONS Phase A: atorvastatin (20 mg) vs placebo. Phase B: randomization 2:1 to subcutaneous evolocumab (420 mg monthly) or oral ezetimibe (10 mg daily). MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES Coprimary end points were the mean percent change in LDL-C level from baseline to the mean of weeks 22 and 24 levels and from baseline to week 24 levels. RESULTS Of the 491 patients who entered phase A (mean age, 60.7 [SD, 10.2] years; 246 women [50.1%]; 170 with coronary heart disease [34.6%]; entry mean LDL-C level, 212.3 [SD, 67.9] mg/dL), muscle symptoms occurred in 209 of 491 (42.6%) while taking atorvastatin but not while taking placebo. Of these, 199 entered phase B, along with 19 who proceeded directly to phase B for elevated creatine kinase (N = 218, with 73 randomized to ezetimibe and 145 to evolocumab; entry mean LDL-C level, 219.9 [SD, 72] mg/dL). For the mean of weeks 22 and 24, LDL-C level with ezetimibe was 183.0 mg/dL; mean percent LDL-C change, -16.7% (95% CI, -20.5% to -12.9%), absolute change, -31.0 mg/dL and with evolocumab was 103.6 mg/dL; mean percent change, -54.5% (95% CI, -57.2% to -51.8%); absolute change, -106.8 mg/dL (P < .001). LDL-C level at week 24 with ezetimibe was 181.5 mg/dL; mean percent change, -16.7% (95% CI, -20.8% to -12.5%); absolute change, -31.2 mg/dL and with evolocumab was 104.1 mg/dL; mean percent change, -52.8% (95% CI, -55.8% to -49.8%); absolute change, -102.9 mg/dL (P < .001). For the mean of weeks 22 and 24, between-group difference in LDL-C was -37.8%; absolute difference, -75.8 mg/dL. For week 24, between-group difference in LDL-C was -36.1%; absolute difference, -71.7 mg/dL. Muscle symptoms were reported in 28.8% of ezetimibe-treated patients and 20.7% of evolocumab-treated patients (log-rank P = .17). Active study drug was stopped for muscle symptoms in 5 of 73 ezetimibe-treated patients (6.8%) and 1 of 145 evolocumab-treated patients (0.7%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with statin intolerance related to muscle-related adverse effects, the use of evolocumab compared with ezetimibe resulted in a significantly greater reduction in LDL-C levels after 24 weeks. Further studies are needed to assess long-term efficacy and safety.

The existence and uniqueness of the solution of the proposed model have been established using the well known Banach fixed point theorem. The model is solved semi-analytically using the Laplace Adomian decomposition Method. The impact of the Atangana-Baleanu fractional derivative on the dynamics of the proposed model is studied. The work also highlights the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on the dynamics of the co-infection of both diseases. The model is fitted to real COVID-19 data from Botswana. The impact of COVID-19 variants on HIV prevalence using simulations is also assessed. Simulation for the class of individuals co-infected with HIV and the wild or Delta COVID-19 variant reveals a significant decrease, as vaccination rate is increased. The impact of fractional order on different epidemiological classes is also studied . Drawing the plot of total infected population with the wild and Delta COVID-19 variants, at different vaccination rates, it is concluded that, as vaccination rate is increased, there is a significant reduction in population infected with the wild and delta COVID-19 variants. The plot of class of individuals co-infected with HIV and the wild or Delta COVID-19 variant is more interesting; as vaccination rate is increased, the co-infected populations experience a significant decrease. Thus, stepping up vaccination against the different variants of COVID-19 could reduce co-infection cases largely, among people already infected with HIV.",2022-03-17,"Omame, Andrew; Isah, Mary Ele; Abbas, Mujahid; Abdel-Aty, Abdel-Haleem; Onyenegecha, Chibueze P.",Alexandria Engineering Journal,,,,,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1110016822001818; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1110016822001818?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aej.2022.03.013,247475546.0

In Hong Kong, care home staff are required to undergo testing for SARS-CoV-2 every two weeks, regardless of symptoms. We aimed to optimize testing strategies in order to improve on existing screening programs.Methods: We estimated the reduced sensitivity of pooled PCR testing and used a decision analysis to determine the expected number of tests required. We assumed transmission occurred according to a time-varying Poisson process and that the time from infection to isolation followed a time-varying geometric distribution. We estimated the cumulative number of cases expected under syndromic surveillance, testing without pooling and pooled testing with pool sizes 2, 5 and 10 using an age of infection model.Findings: Assuming a prevalence of 0.02%, pooling 10 samples and conducting testing every two days instead of testing without pooling every 14 days could reduce the average size of an outbreak from between 2 and 14 cases (median 7 cases) to between 1 and 6 cases (median 2 cases). Pooling to allow for daily testing further reduced the average size of an outbreak from 4 cases to 1 case compared to weekly testing.Interpretation: Health authorities can improve on existing screening programs by employing pooled testing procedures and testing individuals more frequently to make the most use of available testing resources.Funding Information: This project was supported by a commissioned grant from the Health and Medical Research Fund, Food and Health Bureau, Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and the Theme-based Research Scheme (Project No. T11-712/19-N) of the Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong SAR Government.Declaration of Interests: BJC consults for Roche, GSK, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Sanofi Pasteur and is supported by the AIR@innoHK program of the Innovation and Technology Commission of the Hong Kong SAR Government.

Among the different disadvantages of this kind of landfilling, leachate is the major concern to public health, which is a toxic byproduct generated from the landfill; and can percolate to the ground water and consequently migrate in surface water. Using systematic review on published data, the present study endeavors to compare the leachate contamination potential of four major landfills of Bangladesh, named Amin Bazar, Matuail, Mogla Bazar and Rowfabad; which are situated in 3 of the 6 big mega cities of Bangladesh and assessed the effects of leachate leakage on surrounding water body as well as on human health. This study, for the first time calculated the leachate pollution index (LPI) for the landfill sites of Bangladesh and found that the LPI of Matuail landfill site (19.81) is much higher which is comparable to some polluted landfill sites of India and Malaysia. The concentrations of several potentially toxic metals found in the surface and ground water in the vicinity of the landfill sites were above the maximum permissible limit values of department of Environment, Bangladesh and World Health Organization (WHO). The human health risk index for toxic heavy metals in different vegetables and rice grain showed high health risk potential for Pb, Cd, Ni, and Mn. The total carcinogenic risk for Ni and Pb are found very high in the edible plants near those landfill sites, suggesting the risk of Ni and Pb induced carcinogenesis by the consumption of those plants. The present conditions of surface, ground water and agriculture products near the landfill sites of Bangladesh are much frightening to the biota and local inhabitants.

BACKGROUND: The contribution of our study is to use qualitative methods to understand nurses' experiences and perceptions of the risk of the contagion linked to the shortage of PPE during the first wave of the pandemic, whose explosive start strained health systems around the globe. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive design according to the Rapid Research Evaluation and Appraisal model. METHODS: Semi‐structured videoconference interviews were conducted to explore the experiences of 29 nurses including staff nurses, nursing supervisors and nursing directors from hospital and community services of the Spanish health system. Interviews lasted 30–45 min and were conducted in May 2020. We carried out a thematic analysis using Dedoose. The COREQ checklist was used to report findings. RESULTS: We identified the following themes and subthemes: 1. Experiences with personal protective equipment: scarcity, inequality, reutilization, self‐protection, delegation of responsibility, and gap between protocols and reality; 2. Perception of the risk of contagion: lack of credibility, lack of trust, lack of support, and meeting subjective needs. CONCLUSIONS: The scarcity of personal protective equipment and inequality in its distribution led nurses to take initiatives to feel more protected. Mid‐ranking supervisors were caught between the responsibility of monitoring and rationing personal protective equipment and providing the necessary protection to nurses. The disjuncture between protocols and the available supply of personal protective equipment caused confusion. Lack of credibility, lack of trust and lack of support from management influenced participants' perception of the risk of contagion. Mid‐ranking supervisors were often responsible for trying to alleviate fear among nursing staff. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Understanding the factors involved in risk perception can be helpful to decision‐makers who help protect nurses in clinical practice.

Since there is neither a vaccine nor a drug for Covid-19, people with an increased risk for severe and fatal courses of disease particularly need protection. Furthermore, factors increasing these risks are of interest in the search of potential treatments. A systematic literature review on the risk factors of severe and fatal Covid-19 courses is presented. METHODS: The review is carried out on PubMed and a publicly available preprint dataset. For analysis, risk factors are categorized and information regarding the study such as study size and location are extracted. The results are compared to risk factors listed by four public authorities from different countries. RESULTS: The 28 records included, eleven of which are preprints, indicate that conditions and comorbidities connected to a poor state of health such as high age, obesity, diabetes and hypertension are risk factors for severe and fatal disease courses. Furthermore, severe and fatal courses are associated with organ damages mainly affecting the heart, liver and kidneys. Coagulation dysfunctions could play a critical role in the organ damaging. Time to hospital admission, tuberculosis, inflammation disorders and coagulation dysfunctions are identified as risk factors found in the review but not mentioned by the public authorities. CONCLUSION: Factors associated with increased risk of severe or fatal disease courses were identified, which include conditions connected with a poor state of health as well as organ damages and coagulation dysfunctions.

In this study, depressive symptomatology, levels of anxiety, and related psychosocial and occupational factors experienced by healthcare professionals in Sri Lanka during COVID -19 were investigated. METHODS: A total of 512 healthcare professionals were surveyed using an online survey. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised-10, and psychosocial and occupational factors predictive of depression and anxiety were included in the survey questionnaire. Logistic regression determined the factors associated with the presence of depressive symptoms and anxiety. RESULTS: Results showed that elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety were experienced by 53.3% and 51.3%, respectively, of the participants. No differences in the prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety were found between those who were exposed and non-exposed to COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patients. Having a fear of being infected with COVID-19 and spreading it among family members were associated with increased risk of depression. Among those exposed to COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patients, poor occupational safety (OR = 2.06, 95% CI 1.25-3.39), stigmatization (OR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.29-3.72), and heavy workload (OR = 2.45, 95% CI 1.53-3.92) were associated with increased risk of elevated depressive symptoms, whilst poor self-confidence (OR = 2.53, 95% CI 1.56-4.09) and heavy workload (OR = 1.94. 95% CI 1.22-3.12) were associated with increased risk of anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Fear of being infected and distress caused by fear of spreading it among family members, stigmatization, poor self-confidence, poor occupational safety and heavy workload are vital risk factors that need to be considered in future psychological support services designed for the healthcare professionals in unprecedented outbreaks like COVID-19.",2021,"Perera, Bilesha; Wickramarachchi, Bimba; Samanmalie, Champika; Hettiarachchi, Manjula",BMC Psychol,,#1150429,,,,,232336434.0

In this study, the emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO), nicotine, and tar from heated tobacco products (HTPs), electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and conventional cigarettes were compared, and their health risks were evaluated by applying the same smoking regime and a loss mechanism of smoking. Twenty VOCs were identified in aerosols from HTPs, 18 VOCs were identified in aerosols from e-cigarettes, and 97 VOCs were identified in aerosols from cigarettes by GC–MS and HPLC analysis. The concentrations of total VOCs (TVOCs) emitted by the three types of tobacco products decreased as follows: e-cigarettes (795.4 mg/100 puffs) > cigarettes (83.29 mg/100 puffs) > HTPs (15.65 mg/100 puffs). The nicotine content was 24.63 ± 2.25 mg/100 puffs for e-cigarettes, 22.94 ± 0.03 mg/100 puffs for cigarettes, and 8.817 ± 0.500 mg/100 puffs for HTPs. When using cigarettes of the same brand, the mass concentrations of VOCs, tar, and CO emitted by HTPs were approximately 81.2%, 95.9%, and 97.5%, respectively, lower than the amounts emitted by cigarettes. The health risk results demonstrated that the noncarcinogenic risk of the three types of tobacco products decreased as follows: cigarettes (3609.05) > HTPs (2449.70) > acceptable level (1) > e-cigarettes (0.91).

While common, such difference-in-median characterizations of effectiveness are but one way to summarize how outcome distributions compare. This paper explores properties of median treatment effects (TEs) as indicators of treatment effectiveness. The paper's main focus is on decisionmaking based on median TEs and it proceeds by considering two paths a decisionmaker might follow. Along one, decisions are based on point-identified differences in medians alongside partially identified median differences; along the other decisions are based on point-identified differences in medians in conjunction with other point-identified parameters. On both paths familiar difference-in-median measures play some role yet in both the traditional standards are augmented with information that will often be relevant in assessing treatments' effectiveness. Implementing either approach is straightforward. In addition to its analytical results the paper considers several policy contexts in which such considerations arise. While the paper is framed by recently reported findings on treatments for COVID-19 and uses several such studies to explore empirically some properties of median-treatment-effect measures of effectiveness, its results should be broadly applicable.",2021,"Mullahy, John",Health Econ,,#covidwho-1118142,,,,,225173159.0

A central question in the COVID-19 pandemic is whether climatic factors modulate its progression. This information is key to epidemiologists and healthcare decision-makers for improving their management plans. Previous attempts to assess the impact of climatic parameters have yielded ambiguous results, either because they were using geographically or temporally restricted data, or because they were comparing infection rates across countries, which were measured differently depending on local screening strategies. In March 2020, the spread of COVID-19 dramatically increased the number of countries recording deaths, providing an opportunity to use mortality rate, which is measured more homogeneously across countries than infection rates, as a descriptor of the COVID-19 outbreak over a large latitudinal range. Here, using data recorded in 208 territories from 88 countries, we show that mortality rate is negatively influenced by warmer air temperature and positively affected by higher relative humidity. Each additional Celsius degree decreases mortality rate by ~4%, while a 1% increase in relative humidity raises mortality rate by ~2%. Temperature is positively correlated with UV-index, for which one unit of increase results in a ~15% decrease in the mortality rate. We also show that other factors contribute to the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak, such as the proportion of vulnerable age classes in the population, access to a non-overwhelmed health system, as well as governmental travel restrictions for controlling the spread of the disease. All of them are critical factors impacting the mortality rate of COVID-19. The influence of climatic factors is a warning to all southern hemisphere countries where winter is coming soon. Northern hemisphere countries should also be warned that climatic factors alone will likely not be sufficient to contain the disease.",2020-04-23,"Quilodran, Claudio S.; Currat, Mathias; Montoya-Burgos, Juan I.",,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/00cf7075c03c7776b8e0e523d205c76c294fcb59.json,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.20072934; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.20.20072934v1?rss=1,216081951.0

Currently, the pathogenic mechanism of PDCoV remains largely unclear, and effective strategies to prevent or treat PDCoV infection are still limited. In this study, the interaction between autophagy and PDCoV replication in LLC-PK1 cells was investigated. We demonstrated that PDCoV infection induced a complete autophagy process. Pharmacologically induced autophagy with rapamycin increased the expression of PDCoV N, while pharmacologically inhibited autophagy with wortmannin decreased the expression of PDCoV N, suggesting that PDCoV-induced autophagy facilitates virus replication. Further experiments showed that PDCoV infection activated p38 signaling pathway to trigger autophagy. Besides, ergosterol peroxide (EP) alleviated PDCoV-induced activation of p38 to suppress autophagy, thus exerting its antiviral effects. Finally, we employed a piglet model of PDCoV infection to demonstrate that EP prevented PDCoV infection by suppressing PDCoV-induced autophagy via p38 signaling pathway in vivo.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the overall clinical effectiveness of HCQ and TCZ in patients with COVID-19. We hypothesize that HCQ and TCZ use in these patients will be associated with a reduction in in-hospital mortality, upgrade to intensive medical care, invasive mechanical ventilation, or acute renal failure needing dialysis. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed to determine the impact of HCQ and TCZ use on hard clinical outcomes during hospitalization. A total of 176 hospitalized patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis was included. Patients were divided into two comparison groups: (1) HCQ (n=144) vs no-HCQ (n=32) and (2) TCZ (n=32) vs no-TCZ (n=144). The mean age, baseline comorbidities, and other medications used during hospitalization were uniformly distributed among all the groups. Independent t tests and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to calculate mean differences and adjusted odds ratios with 95% CIs, respectively. RESULTS: The unadjusted odds ratio for patients upgraded to a higher level of care (ie, intensive care unit) (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.19-5.69; P=.003) and reductions in C-reactive protein (CRP) level on day 7 of hospitalization (21% vs 56%, OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.08-0.55; P=.002) were significantly higher in the TCZ group compared to the control group. There was no significant difference in the odds of in-hospital mortality, upgrade to intensive medical care, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, acute kidney failure necessitating dialysis, or discharge from the hospital after recovery in both the HCQ and TCZ groups compared to their respective control groups. Adjusted odds ratios controlled for baseline comorbidities and medications closely followed the unadjusted estimates. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients with COVID-19, neither HCQ nor TCZ offered a significant reduction in in-hospital mortality, upgrade to intensive medical care, invasive mechanical ventilation, or acute renal failure needing dialysis. These results are similar to the recently published preliminary results of the HCQ arm of the Recovery trial, which showed no clinical benefit from the use of HCQ in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (the TCZ arm is ongoing).

4loskqbs,,WHO,The link between COVID-19 and VItamin D (VIVID): A systematic review and meta-analysis,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: Disease severity and mortality rates due to COVID-19 infection are greater in the elderly and chronically ill patients, populations at high risk for vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D plays an important role in immune function and inflammation. This systematic review and meta-analysis assesses the impact of vitamin D status and supplementation on COVID-19 related mortality and health outcomes. METHODS: We searched four databases until December 18th 2020, and trial registries until January 20th 2021. Two reviewers screened the studies, collected data, assessed the risk of bias, and graded the evidence for each outcome across studies, independently and in duplicate. Pre-specified outcomes of interest were mortality, ICU admission, invasive and non-invasive ventilation, hospitalization, time of hospital stay, disease severity and SARS-CoV-2 positivity. We only included data from peer-reviewed articles in our primary analyses. RESULTS: We identified 31 peer-reviewed observational studies. In our primary analysis, there was a positive trend between serum 25(OH)D level <20â¯ng/ml and an increased risk of mortality, ICU admission, invasive ventilation, non-invasive ventilation or SARS-CoV-2 positivity. However, these associations were not statistically significant. Mean 25(OH)D levels was 5.9â¯ng/ml (95% CI [-9.5, -2.3]) significantly lower in COVID-19 positive, compared to negative patients. The certainty of the evidence was very low. We identified 32 clinical trial protocols, but only three have published results to-date. The trials administer vitamin D doses of 357 to 60,000â¯IU/day, from one week to 12â¯months. Eight megatrials investigate the efficacy of vitamin D in outpatient populations. A pilot trial revealed a significant decrease in ICU admission with calcifediol, compared to placebo (ORâ¯=â¯0.003), but the certainty of the evidence was unclear. Another small trial showed that supplementation with cholecalciferol, 60,000â¯IU/day, decreased fibrinogen levels, but did not have an effect on D-dimer, procalcitonin and CRP levels, compared to placebo. The third trial did not find any effect of vitamin D supplementation on COVID-19 related health outcomes. CONCLUSION: While the available evidence to-date, from largely poor-quality observational studies, may be viewed as showing a trend for an association between low serum 25(OH)D levels and COVID-19 related health outcomes, this relationship was not found to be statistically significant. Calcifediol supplementation may have a protective effect on COVID-19 related ICU admissions. The current use of high doses of vitamin D in COVID-19 patients is not based on solid evidence. It awaits results from ongoing trials to determine the efficacy, desirable doses, and safety, of vitamin D supplementation to prevent and treat COVID-19 related health outcomes.",2021,"Bassatne, Aya; Basbous, Maya; Chakhtoura, Marlene; El Zein, Ola; Rahme, Maya; El-Hajj Fuleihan, Ghada",Metabolism,,#covidwho-1152589,,,,,232341475.0

Then, the excited carriers realize efficient recombination luminescence through the self-trapped excitons inside Cs4PbBr6. On the basis of this mechanism, the heterostructure composite scintillator composed of CsI:Na/Cs4PbBr6 exhibits high-efficiency radiant fluorescence and an ultrafast photoluminescence (PL) decay time of 1.22 ns.

In Ethiopia, more specifically in the capital city of Addis Ababa, a sudden increase in the number of confirmed positive cases in high-risk groups of the community has been observed over the last few weeks of the first case. Therefore, this study aims to assess knowledge, practice and associated factors that can contribute to the prevention of COVID-19 among high-risk groups in Addis Ababa. METHODS: A cross-sectional in person survey (n = 6007) was conducted from 14-30 April, 2020 following a prioritization within high-risk groups in Addis Ababa. The study area targeted bus stations, public transport drivers, air transport infrastructure, health facilities, public and private pharmacies, hotels, government-owned and private banks, telecom centers, trade centers, orphanages, elderly centers, prison, prisons and selected slum areas where the people live in a crowded areas. A questionnaire comprised of four sections (demographics, knowledge, practice and reported symptoms) was used for data collection. The outcomes (knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 and practice) were measured using four items. A multi variable logistic regression was applied with adjustment for potential confounding. RESULTS: About half (48%, 95% CI: 46-49) of the study participants had poor knowledge on the transmission mode of COVID-19 whereas six out of ten (60%, 95% CI: 58-61) had good knowledge on prevention methods for COVID-19. The practice of preventive measures towards COVID-19 was found to be low (49%, 95% CI: 48-50). Factors that influence knowledge on COVID-19 transmission mechanisms were female gender, older age, occupation (health care and grocery worker), lower income and the use of the 8335 free call centre. Older age, occupation (being a health worker), middle income, experience of respiratory illness and religion were significantly associated with being knowledgeable about the prevention methods for COVID-19. The study found that occupation, religion, income, knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 were associated with the practice of precautionary measures towards COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The study highlighted that there was moderate knowledge about transmission modes and prevention mechanisms. Similarly, there was moderate practice of measures that contribute towards the prevention of COVID-19 among these priority and high-risk communities of Addis Ababa. There is an urgent need to fill the knowledge gap in terms of transmission mode and prevention methods of COVID-19 to improve prevention practices and control the spread of COVID-19.

However, data on the prevalence, microbiology, and outcomes of co-infection and superinfection are limited. The purpose of this study was to examine the occurrence of co-infections and superinfections and their outcomes among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We searched literature databases for studies published from October 1, 2019, through February 8, 2021. We included studies that reported clinical features and outcomes of co-infection or superinfection of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens in hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. We followed PRISMA guidelines, and we registered the protocol with PROSPERO as: CRD42020189763. RESULTS: Of 6639 articles screened, 118 were included in the random effects meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of co-infection was 19% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14%-25%, I(2) = 98%) and that of superinfection was 24% (95% CI: 19%-30%). Pooled prevalence of pathogen type stratified by co- or superinfection were: viral co-infections, 10% (95% CI: 6%-14%); viral superinfections, 4% (95% CI: 0%-10%); bacterial co-infections, 8% (95% CI: 5%-11%); bacterial superinfections, 20% (95% CI: 13%-28%); fungal co-infections, 4% (95% CI: 2%-7%); and fungal superinfections, 8% (95% CI: 4%-13%). Patients with a co-infection or superinfection had higher odds of dying than those who only had SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratio = 3.31, 95% CI: 1.82–5.99). Compared to those with co-infections, patients with superinfections had a higher prevalence of mechanical ventilation (45% [95% CI: 33%-58%] vs. 10% [95% CI: 5%-16%]), but patients with co-infections had a greater average length of hospital stay than those with superinfections (mean = 29.0 days, standard deviation [SD] = 6.7 vs. mean = 16 days, SD = 6.2, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that as many as 19% of patients with COVID-19 have co-infections and 24% have superinfections.

The purpose of this study was to characterize obesity prevalence among children, adolescents, and young adults receiving inpatient care in Hawai‘i acute care hospitals during 2015–2016. This study analyzed statewide administrative data from a racially and ethnically diverse population. Participants (N = 7,751) included Hawai‘i residents aged 5–29 years receiving inpatient care, excluding those hospitalized due to pregnancy. Recorded height and weight were used to calculate body mass index (BMI) and classify obesity. Primary or secondary diagnoses for obesity were assessed. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to determine characteristics associated with obesity, including race/ethnicity-sex interaction, age group, insurance payer, and county of residence. Based on BMI, 28.4% (2,202/7,751) of patients had obesity. However, an obesity diagnosis was present only in 40.4% (889/2,202) of patients with obesity based on BMI (11.9% of all patients). In the multivariable model, compared to whites, the odds of having obesity were highest among Pacific Islanders [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 4.07, 95% CI(3.16–5.23)] and Native Hawaiians [aOR = 2.16, 95% CI(1.75–2.67)] for females, and among Pacific Islanders [aOR = 5.39, 95% CI(4.27–6.81)], Native Hawaiians [aOR = 2.36, 95% CI(1.91–2.91)], and Filipinos [aOR = 2.08, 95% CI(1.64–2.64)] for males.

The absence of a globally distributed effective treatment makes the exploration of new mechanisms of action a key step to address this situation. Stabilization of non-native Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) of the nucleocapsid protein of MERS-CoV has been reported as a valid strategy to inhibit viral replication. In this study, the applicability of this unexplored mechanism of action against SARS-CoV-2 is analyzed. During our research, we were able to find three inducible interfaces of SARS-CoV-2 N protein NTD, compare them to the previously reported MERS-CoV stabilized dimers, and identify those residues that are responsible for their formation. A drug discovery protocol implemented consisting of docking, molecular dynamics and MM-GBSA enabled us to find several compounds that might be able to exploit this mechanism of action. In addition, a common catechin skeleton was found among many of these molecules, which might be useful for further drug design. We consider that our findings could motivate future research in the fields of drug discovery and design towards the exploitation of this previously unexplored mechanism of action against COVID-19.

Vaccine development and production needs to be sufficient to meet a vast global demand, requiring international cooperation and local vaccine production capacity, especially in resource-constrained countries. The use of adjuvants is one approach to augment the number of available vaccine doses and to overcome potential vaccine shortages. Appropriately selected adjuvant technologies can decrease the amount of vaccine antigen required per dose, may broaden or lengthen the conferred protection against disease, and may even allow protective single-dose vaccination. Here we describe a technology transfer collaboration between Switzerland and Indonesia that led to the establishment of a vaccine formulation platform in Surabaya which involved the transfer of equipment and expertise to enable research and development of adjuvanted vaccine formulations and delivery systems. This new Indonesian capability aims to facilitate local and regional access to know-how relating to adjuvanted vaccine formulations, thus promoting their application to local vaccine developers.

In line with UK government guidelines on social distancing, the use of telemedicine was implemented to facilitate the ongoing provision of cancer rehabilitation. PURPOSE: We sought to evaluate and co-design telemedicine services to meet the complex needs of our patients and carers at a tertiary cancer centre. METHODS: Experience-based co-design methodology was adapted to include virtual methods. Staff members (n = 12) and patients (n = 11) who had delivered or received therapies services at our UK cancer centre since March 2020 were recruited to take part in one-to-one virtual interviews. Patient interviews were video recorded, analysed and edited to a 30-min “trigger film”. Patient and staff virtual events were undertaken thereafter. A joint virtual patient and staff event occurred. Staff and patients watched the trigger film and as partners, agreed areas for change and developed groups for service co-design. RESULTS: Positive aspects regarding telemedicine provision were highlighted including reduced financial and time burden on patients, and increased flexibility for both staff and patients. The key concerns included digital exclusion, safety, communication and patient choice. Four co-design groups have been established to enact changes in these priority areas.

However, there is not a perfect correspondence between transmission history and virus phylogeny. Both node height and topological differences may occur, depending on the interaction between within-host evolutionary dynamics and between-host transmission patterns. To investigate these interactions, we added a within-host evolutionary model in epidemiological simulations and examined if the resulting phylogeny could recover different types of contact networks. To further improve realism, we also introduced patient-specific differences in infectivity across disease stages, and on the epidemic level we considered incomplete sampling and the age of the epidemic. Second, we implemented an inference method based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to discriminate among three well-studied network models and jointly estimate both network parameters and key epidemiological quantities such as the infection rate. Our ABC framework used both topological and distance-based tree statistics for comparison between simulated and observed trees. Overall, our simulations showed that a virus time-scaled phylogeny (genealogy) may be substantially different from the between-host transmission tree. This has important implications for the interpretation of what a phylogeny reveals about the underlying epidemic contact network. In particular, we found that while the within-host evolutionary process obscures the transmission tree, the diversification process and infectivity dynamics also add discriminatory power to differentiate between different types of contact networks. We also found that the possibility to differentiate contact networks depends on how far an epidemic has progressed, where distance-based tree statistics have more power early in an epidemic.

Design We used a large national multi-payer claims dataset from January 2019 through October 2020 to examine trends in post-hospital-discharge location and spending Setting and participants We identified and included 975,179 hospital discharges who were 65 years or older. Methods We summarized post-discharge utilization and spending in each month of the study: (1) the percentage of patients discharged from the hospital to home for selfcare and to the three common post-acute care locations: home with home health, skilled nursing facility (SNF) and inpatient rehabilitation; (2) the rate of discharge to each location per 100,000 insured members in our cohort; (3) the total amount spent per month in each post-acute care location; and (4) the percentage of spending in each post-acute care location out of the total spending across the three post-acute care settings. Results The percentage of patients discharged from the hospital to home or to inpatient rehabilitation did not meaningfully change during the pandemic while the percentage discharged to SNF declined from 19% of discharges in 2019 to 14% by October 2020. Total monthly spending declined in each of the three post-acute care locations, with the largest relative decline in SNFs of 55%, from an average of $42 million per month in 2019 to $19 million in October 2020. Declines in total monthly spending were smaller in home health (a 41% decline) and inpatient rehabilitation (a 32% decline). As a percentage of all post-acute care spending, spending on SNFs declined from 39% to 31% while the percentage of post-acute care spending on home health and inpatient rehabilitation both increased.

Given that the pandemic has impacted people’s lives across countries in divergent ways – both in terms of spread and in terms of government-imposed measures, we investigated whether audience perceptions of metaphors for the COVID-19 pandemic depend on source domain and country context. This mixed-design study examined how individuals across three European countries (Germany, Italy, and The Netherlands) perceived different COVID-19 metaphorical frames. Participants (N = 216) were randomly exposed to nine metaphorical frames and one literal-language frame and asked to express their perceptions in terms of liking, aptness, complexity, conventionality, and credibility. Results showed that audience perceptions of metaphorical descriptions of the COVID-19 pandemic differed between source domains and country contexts, but mostly in terms of aptness. These findings suggest that experience with the target domain may indeed be relevant for metaphor perceptions and highlight the importance of studying metaphor appreciation as a multifaceted phenomenon.

This allows us to find the expected size of the giant connected component (GCC) of two sequential bond percolation processes in which the bond occupancy probability of the second process is modulated (increased or decreased) by a node being inside or outside of the GCC created by the first process. In the context of epidemic spreading this amounts to both an antagonistic partial immunity and a synergistic partial coinfection interaction between the two sequential diseases. We examine configuration model networks with tunable clustering. We find that the emergent evolutionary behavior of the second strain is highly dependent on the details of the coupling between the strains.

METHODS: We assessed whether proteinuria can be predictive of kidney failure, the development of chronic kidney disease, and mortality in 37 critically ill COVID-19 patients. We used machine learning (ML) methods as decision trees and cut-off points created by the OneR package to add new aspects, even in smaller cohorts. RESULTS: Among a total of 37 patients, 24 suffered higher-grade renal failure, 20 of whom required kidney replacement therapy. More than 40% of patients remained on hemodialysis after intensive care unit discharge or died (27%). Due to frequent anuria proteinuria measured in two-thirds of the patients, it was not predictive for the investigated endpoints; albuminuria was higher in patients with AKI 3, but the difference was not significant. ML found cut-off points of >31.4 kg/m(2) for BMI and >69 years for age, constructed decision trees with great accuracy, and identified highly predictive variables for outcome and remaining chronic kidney disease.

This study aimed to examine the association between allergic diseases and ADHD adjusted for exposure to parental smoking at home in early adolescents. We recruited 250 male (41.7%) and 350 female (58.3%) adolescents (mean [SD] age, 13.29 [0.52] years) via chain-referral sampling. Their ADHD symptoms were assessed by the parent proxy-report version of the Chinese Strengths and Weaknesses of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity-symptoms and Normal-behaviours (SWAN) rating scale. Data on the participants’ history of clinician-diagnosed allergic diseases, family socio-demographics, and parental smoking habit were collected using a parent-completed questionnaire. Regression analyses were performed to examine the associations of interest. The levels of ADHD symptoms were comparable between allergic and non-allergic participants after controlling for child and family demographics and parental smoking at home. Notably, the risk of probable ADHD was particularly high in participants with food allergies (odd ratio = 4.51, p = 0.011) but not in those with allergic rhinitis after adjusting for parental smoking at home. Our findings suggest that second-hand smoke exposure at home is a potential risk factor underlying the link between ADHD and allergic diseases.

METHODS All acute hospitals in the UK were invited to participate. Data were collected on unit structure, and for patients admitted to acute medicine services over a 24-hour period, with follow-up at 7 days. RESULTS 158 units participated in SAMBA21, from 156 hospitals. 8973 patients were included. The number of admissions per unit had increased compared to SAMBA19 (Sign test p<0.005). An early warning score was recorded within 30 minutes of hospital arrival in 77.4% of patients. 87.4% of unplanned admissions were seen by a tier 1 clinician within 4 hours of arrival. Overall, the medical team performed the initial clinician assessment for 36.4% of unplanned medical admissions. More than a third of medical admissions had their initial assessment in Same Day Emergency Care (SDEC) in 25.4% of hospitals. 62.1% of unplanned admissions were seen by two other clinical decision makers prior to consultant review. Of those unplanned admissions requiring consultant review, 67.8% were seen within the target time. More than a third of unplanned admissions were discharged the same day in 41.8% of units. CONCLUSION Performance against the CQIs for acute medicine was maintained in comparison to previous rounds of SAMBA, despite increased admissions. There remains considerable variation in unit structure and performance within acute medical services.",2022,"Atkin, C; Knight, T; Cooksley, T; Holland, M; Subbe, C; Kennedy, A; Varia, R; Lasserson, D",Acute medicine,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.52964/amja.0888; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35342906/,247763886.0

For diabetic patients, maintaining regular contact with healthcare providers and visiting healthcare centers are crucial to patients’ overall ability to control their glycemic status. OBJECTIVE: To assess patients’ knowledge regarding the use of insulin injection devices and the challenges these patients face in obtaining medical advice, as well as to suggest alternative solutions for addressing these challenges among diabetic patients self-administering their injections during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted among a sample population (N = 178) of diabetic patients attending Security Forces Hospital–Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from which the Institutional Review Board (IRB) was granted. Data was collected using a self-administered questionnaire, which was distributed from August to September 2020. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) program (version 21). Significant P-value = < 0.05. RESULTS: The majority of patients had good knowledge and practice explained with values 73.6% of total papulation. Sixty-four percent of patients with type 1 diabetes and 59% of patients with type 2 diabetes reported experiencing moderately severe challenges obtaining counseling. There was no correlation between severity of disease and knowledge levels (p-value = 0.36). The most appropriate means of obtaining counseling was determined to be conversations with healthcare providers; this strategy received an overall average score of 4.9 ± 0.4 (p-value < 0.0001).

In addition to pneumonia, Cardiac failure is also a clinical outcome of coronavirus (COVID-19) patients and one of the leading causes for the death of COVID-19 patients. This study focused on a spectrum of cardiac enzymes to provide biomarkers for the severity of cardiomyopathy, and provide guidance of clinical treatment. Methods 230 coronavirus patients (182 mild and 48 severe cases) enrolled in Three Gorges Hospital of Chongqing University from January to March 2020 were analyzed for a spectrum of cardiac injury enzymes including α-hydroxybutyric dehydrogenase (αHBDH), lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), and creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB). Results The severe cases had significantly higher myocardial enzyme levels than mild cases, regardless of male and females. Males appeared to be more susceptible than females to COVID-19 induced heart injury, having higher CK and CK-MB in mild cases, and higher αHBDH and LDH levels in severe cases. Age is also a susceptible factor to COVID-19, but affected males were younger than females.

ijoevyp0,,WHO,Delay to elective colorectal cancer surgery and implications for survival: a systematic review and meta-analysis,,,,unk,"AIM: The Covid-19 pandemic has delayed elective colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery. The aim of this study was to see whether or not this may affect overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). METHOD: A systematic review was carried out according to PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO ID: CRD42020189158). Medline, EMBASE and Scopus were interrogated. Patients aged over 18 years with a diagnosis of colon or rectal cancer who received elective surgery as their primary treatment were included. Delay to elective surgery was defined as the period between CRC diagnosis and the day of surgery. Meta-analysis of the outcomes OS and DFS were conducted. Forest plots, funnel plots and tests of heterogeneity were produced. An estimated number needed to harm (NNH) was calculated for statistically significant pooled hazard ratios (HRs). RESULTS: Of 3753 articles identified, seven met the inclusion criteria. Encompassing 314 560 patients, three of the seven studies showed that a delay to elective resection is associated with poorer OS or DFS. OS was assessed at a 1 month delay, the HR for six datasets was 1.13 (95% CI 1.02-1.26, p = 0.020) and at 3 months the pooled HR for three datasets was 1.57 (95% CI 1.16-2.12, p = 0.004). The estimated NNH for a delay at 1 month and 3 months was 35 and 10 respectively. Delay was nonsignificantly negatively associated with DFS on meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: This review recommends that elective surgery for CRC patients is not postponed longer than 4 weeks, as available evidence suggests extended delays from diagnosis are associated with poorer outcomes. Focused research is essential so patient groups can be prioritized based on risk factors in future delays or pandemics.",2021,"Whittaker, Thomas M; Abdelrazek, Mohamed E G; Fitzpatrick, Aran J; Froud, Joseph L J; Kelly, Jack R; Williamson, Jeremy S; Williams, Gethin L",Colorectal dis,,#1150113,,,,,232223237.0

A-to-I RNA editing has been shown to directly affect the genome/transcriptome of RNA viruses with significant repercussions for viral protein synthesis, proliferation and infectivity, while it also affects recognition of double-stranded RNAs by cytosolic receptors controlling the host innate immune response. Recent evidence suggests that RNA editing may be present in SARS-CoV-2 genome/transcriptome. The majority of mapped mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome are A-to-G/U-to-C(opposite strand) and C-to-U/G-to-A(opposite strand) substitutions comprising potential ADAR-/APOBEC-mediated deamination events. A single nucleotide substitution can have dramatic effects on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity as shown by the D614G(A-to-G) substitution in the spike protein.

Apixaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, shows excellent efficacy against stroke and deep vein thrombosis in humans. The purpose of this study was to determine serum apixaban concentrations and anti-factor Xa activity in horses after orally administered apixaban. Five horses received a single dose of intravenous (0.09 mg/kg) and oral (1 mg/kg) apixaban in a cross-over design. Serum apixaban concentrations and anti-Xa activity were measured serially via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and a commercial assay, respectively, for 12 hr following oral administration. Apixaban was detected in all horses after both oral and intravenous administration. Oral administration yielded a mean maximum concentration of 60.3 ng/ml (59.4-111 ng/ml), mean time to maximum concentration of 0.5 hr (0.5-2), mean half-life of 6.2 hr (4.6-8.3), and mean oral bioavailability of 10% (3.8-17.4). After oral administration, anti-Xa activity had a strong positive relationship with serum apixaban and was best represented by a dose-response model with the following parameters: E0 = 5.00 ng/ml, EMAX = 311 ng/mL, EC50 = 267 ng/ml, and n = 1.58. Anti-Xa activity was significantly higher 2 hr post-administration compared with baseline (p = .032).

The objective of this study is to assess the anxiety, depression levels, and psychological resilience of physicians working during the Covid-19 outbreak and to evaluate the related factors that are associated with their psychological resilience. METHODS: The sample of this descriptive study was composed of medical doctors and dentists. The data were obtained online between April 13-23, 2020 through a survey prepared by the researchers. In addition, a questionnaire about the participants' sociodemographic characteristics, the Psychological Resilience Scale and Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HAD-A/HAD-D) was given. RESULTS: The average age of the 671 participants was 44.0 ± 9.0 years. Psychological resilience scores were significantly higher in those who had children, who had worked for 15 years or more, and who had received training about COVID-19 (p < 0.05). Depression scores were higher among women and in those who reported having a chronic disease, whose workload increased after the outbreak, and who had physical contact with COVID-positive patients. The anxiety scores were also higher among women and in those whose workload had increased and who had contact with COVID-positive patients (p < 0.05). The physicians with scores below the cutoff point on the HAD-D/HAD-A had significantly higher scores on the Psychological Resilience Scale (p < 0.05). DISCUSSION: Depression and anxiety levels were found to be significantly lower in physicians with greater psychological resilience.

Objectives To monitor 23 serious outcomes weekly, using comprehensive health records on a diverse population. Design, Setting, and Participants This study represents an interim analysis of safety surveillance data from Vaccine Safety Datalink. The 10 162 227 vaccine-eligible members of 8 participating US health plans were monitored with administrative data updated weekly and supplemented with medical record review for selected outcomes from December 14, 2020, through June 26, 2021.

Main Outcomes and Measures Incidence of serious outcomes, including acute myocardial infarction, Bell palsy, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myocarditis/pericarditis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome. Incidence of events that occurred among vaccine recipients 1 to 21 days after either dose 1 or 2 of a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine was compared with that of vaccinated concurrent comparators who, on the same calendar day, had received their most recent dose 22 to 42 days earlier. Rate ratios (RRs) were estimated by Poisson regression, adjusted for age, sex, race and ethnicity, health plan, and calendar day. For a signal, a 1-sided P < .0048 was required to keep type I error below .05 during 2 years of weekly analyses. For 4 additional outcomes, including anaphylaxis, only descriptive analyses were conducted. Results A total of 11 845 128 doses of mRNA vaccines (57% BNT162b2; 6 175 813 first doses and 5 669 315 second doses) were administered to 6.2 million individuals (mean age, 49 years; 54% female individuals).

In the current threat landscape, a targeted phishing attack (i.e., spear phishing) often constitutes the first action of a threat actor during an intrusion campaign. To tackle this threat, many data-driven approaches have been proposed, which mostly rely on the use of supervised machine learning under a single-layer approach. However, such approaches are resource-demanding and, thus, their deployment in production environments is infeasible. Moreover, most previous works utilise a feature set that can be easily tampered with by adversaries. In this paper, we investigate the use of a multi-layered detection framework in which a potential phishing domain is classified multiple times by models using different feature sets. In our work, an additional classification takes place only when the initial one scores below a predefined confidence level, which is set by the system owner. We demonstrate our approach by implementing a two-layered detection system, which uses supervised machine learning to identify phishing attacks.

Such transformations allow them to acquire the chemical–physical properties needed for fulling several activities including metabolic regulation, antimicrobial functions and solubilization of lipids in digestion. The versatility of BAs in the physiological functions has inspired their use in many bio-applications, making them important tools for active molecule delivery, metabolic disease treatments and emulsification processes in food and drug industries. Moreover, moving over the borders of the biological field, BAs have been largely investigated as building blocks for the construction of supramolecular aggregates having peculiar structural, mechanical, chemical and optical properties.

Similar results were obtained for other human coronaviruses. Conversely, in the SARS-CoV-2 population, epitopes for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were not more variable than non-epitope positions. A significant reduction in epitope variability was instead observed for some of the most immunogenic proteins (S, N, ORF8, and ORF3a).

1cs9sofu,,WHO,Vitamin D in COVID - 19: Dousing the fire or averting the storm? - A perspective from the Asia-Pacific,,,,unk,"COVID-19, the acute respiratory tract infection (RTI) caused by the Coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, has swept around the world. No country has been spared from its onslaught. Treatments that can reduce the risk of infection and mortality from the disease are desperately needed. Though high quality randomized controlled trials are lacking, some observational and interventional studies that explore the link between vitamin D and RTIs exist. Vitamin D modulates both innate as well as adaptive immunity and may potentially prevent or mitigate the complications associated with RTIs. Evidence linking vitamin D to COVID-19 include that the outbreak occurred in winter in the northern hemisphere at a time when vitamin D levels are lowest in resident populations, that blacks and minority ethnic individuals who are known to have lower levels of vitamin D appear to be disproportionately affected and have more severe complications from the disease, that vitamin D deficiency has been shown to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome and that case fatality rates increase with age and in populations with comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, all of which are associated with lower vitamin D levels. This narrative review summarizes the current knowledge about the epidemiology and pathophysiology of COVID-19, the evidence linking vitamin D and RTIs, especially COVID-19, the mechanistic reasons behind the possible protective effect of vitamin D in COVID-19, and the evidence with regard to vitamin D supplementation in RTIs.

This study identified the various clinical prognostic factors for SARS and described the temporal evolution of these factors in the course of the SARS illness in Hong Kong in 2003. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the entire Hong Kong cohort of 1312 laboratory‐confirmed SARS patients aged 15–74 years was undertaken. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data at presentation and investigative data during the first 10 days of illness from the time of symptom onset were compiled. Two adverse outcomes were examined: hospital mortality and the development of oxygenation failure based on the estimated PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio of <200 mm Hg. Logistic regression was used to identify the association between these prognostic factors and outcomes. Results: Based on adjusted odds ratios with a P‐value of <0.05, older age, male gender, elevated pulse rate and elevated neutrophil count were all predictive of oxygenation failure and death during the 10‐day illness. Raised serum albumin and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels were predictive of hospital mortality during this period. The presenting ALT and CPK level and the day 7 and day 10 platelet counts were predictive of oxygenation failure while the day 7 LDH was predictive of death. Contact exposure outside health‐care institutions also appeared to carry higher risk of death. Conclusion: This large‐scale analysis identified important discriminatory parameters related to the patients’ demographic profile (age and gender), severity of illness (pulse rate and neutrophil count), and multisystem derangement (platelet count, CPK, ALT and LDH), all of which prognosticated adverse outcomes during the SARS episode. While age, pulse rate and neutrophil count consistently remained significant prognosticators during the first 10 days of illness, the prognostic impact of other derangements was more time‐course dependent.

The sudden draconian measures changed the delivery of dental education and practice throughout the country. The study aimed to screen for depression during the COVID-19 lockdown and the factors associated with it among dental students and practitioners in highly COVID-19 infected states of India. Materials and Methods The current study is an online cross-sectional survey performed in Delhi NCR, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu during May 2020. The participants were recruited by convenience sampling. The main outcome measure was the screening of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), which was categorized as mild, moderate, and severe depression. The data analysis was performed with IBM SPSS Version 23.0. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to identify the independent predictors of depression. Results In total, 335 dental students and practitioners participated in the survey. Among this, a significant number of the dental students (54%) and practitioners (44%) scored moderate to severe depression in terms of depression severity according to the PHQ-9 scores. Those who were screened depressed were likely to be males and younger than 30 years old. The results of correlation analysis indicated that worry about the professional growth, concerns regarding setbacks in clinical and research experiences, previous history of mental health issues, and fear of contracting COVID-19 from patients were positively related to higher depression scores in students. Moreover, for practitioners, fear of contracting COVID-19 from the patients scored higher levels of depression. The practitioners who reported less concern about their practice/job post COVID-19 lockdown and those who were able to meet their financial expenses during the lockdown were the least likely to be depressed.

Travellers visiting friends and relatives (VFR) are at higher risk of acquiring infections than other travellers, therefore improving the travel health behaviour of these travellers is important. Ethnic Chinese are one of the largest migrant groups in many countries, yet there have been no published studies regarding this population as VFR travellers. We present findings of a study of Australian Chinese VFR travellers relevant to the pandemic response. METHODS: In 2013, five focus groups were conducted with Australian Chinese VFR travellers, exploring topics such as vaccines, face masks, outbreaks and travel health seeking behaviour. Participants were aged 18 years or older and had travelled to China for VFR purposes in the preceding 18 months. Sessions were recorded and transcribed, and thematic analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: Participants viewed VFR travel as low risk, and underestimated the risks associated with travelling during an outbreak. However, they were generally willing to receive pre-travel vaccination specifically for an outbreak, but not otherwise. Attitudes towards face masks and other infection control measures were mixed. Multiple factors influenced their travel health behaviour, including low risk awareness, misconceptions, and cultural barriers to seeking health care. CONCLUSION: Our research found that Chinese VFR travellers undertake suboptimal precautions related to VFR travel, associated with an underestimation of risks. While they share many characteristics with other VFR travellers, unique cultural health beliefs should be taken into account when developing risk communication and educational interventions as part of a pandemic response.",2020,"Ma, Tara; Heywood, Anita; MacIntyre, C Raina",Infect.

The rapid spread in the UK of this new variant has caused other countries to be vigilant.

Subsequently, we confirmed the B.1.1.7 candidates by whole genome sequencing. RESULTS: We describe the first three imported cases of this variant from London to Madrid, subsequent post-arrival household transmission to three relatives, and the two first cases without epidemiological links to UK. One case required hospitalization. In all cases, drop-out of gene S was correctly associated to the B.1.1.7 variant, as all the corresponding sequences carried the 17 lineage-marker mutations.

Benefiting from KOH activation, the PBCKOH was found to possess huge specific surface area of 2183.80 m2/g and many well-developed micropores with average particle size of 2.75 nm and main pore diameters distribution from 1 to 2 nm. The PBCKOH presented an excellent adsorption performance with a theoretical monolayer uptake of 116.97 mg/g for Cr(VI) and a heterogeneous adsorption capacity of 450.43 mg/g for NAP. The uptake equilibrium was attained within about 120 min for Cr(VI), while about 180 min for NAP following avrami fractional-order model, revealing the existence of multiple kinetics during the adsorption. The thermodynamic results showed that the uptake of both Cr(VI) and NAP occurred spontaneously (-ΔG°), while in an endothermic nature for Cr(VI) (+ΔH°) and an exothermic characteristic for NAP (-ΔH°) with different randomness.

While the incidence of end-stage kidney disease continues to increase globally, the use of home dialysis remains low in most developed countries. Multiple barriers to providing home dialysis have been noted in the published literature. Amongst known challenges, gaps in clinician knowledge are potentially addressable with a focused education strategy. Recent national surveys in the United States and Australia have highlighted the need for enhanced home dialysis knowledge especially among nephrologists who have recently completed training. Traditional in-person continuing professional educational programs have had modest success in promoting home dialysis and are limited by scale and the present global COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesize that the use of a ""Hub and Spoke"" model of virtual home dialysis mentorship for nephrologists based on project ECHO would support home dialysis growth.

Among various influenza vaccine types, the inactivated subunit type is known to provide improved safety with reduced reactogenicity. However, there are some drawbacks associated with inactivated subunit type vaccines, with the main ones being its low immunogenicity and the induction of Th2-biased immune responses. In this study, we investigated the role of a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) derived from the intergenic region in the internal ribosome entry site of the Cricket paralysis virus as an adjuvant rather than the universal vaccine for a seasonal inactivated subunit influenza vaccine. The ssRNA adjuvant stimulated not only well-balanced cellular (indicated by IgG2a, IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α) and humoral (indicated by IgG1 and IL-4) immune responses but also a mucosal immune response (indicated by IgA), a key protector against respiratory virus infections. It also increases the HI titer, the surrogate marker of influenza vaccine efficacy. Furthermore, ssRNA adjuvant confers cross-protective immune responses against heterologous influenza virus infection while promoting enhanced viral clearance. Moreover, ssRNA adjuvant increases the number of memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which can be expected to induce long-term immune responses. Therefore, this ssRNA-adjuvanted seasonal inactivated subunit influenza vaccine might be the best influenza vaccine generating robust humoral and cellular immune responses and conferring cross-protective and long-term immunity.",2020-07-29,"Kim, Yun-Hee; Bang, Yoo-Jin; Park, Hyo-Jung; Li Ko, Hae; Park, Sang-In; Hwang, Kyung-Ah; Kim, Hun; Nam, Jae-Hwan",Vaccine,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.07.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32739118/,220941491.0

Samples were analyzed by whole genome sequencing analysis (n=489) or TaqMan assay (n=808). Results After the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta strain, the Omicron strain spread rapidly in Yamanashi, Japan. BA.1.1 was the predominant sublineage of the Omicron strain from January to mid-February 2022, but the number of cases of sublineage BA.2 began to increase after mid-February, and this sublineage was shown to have replaced BA.1.1 by the end of March 2022. We observed higher viral and antigen levels of sublineage BA.2 than of sublineage BA.1.1 in nasopharyngeal swab samples. However, no difference in viral load by patient age was apparent between sublineages BA.1.1 and BA.2.

One of the newest variants is Omicron, which shows an increase in its transmissibility, but also reportedly reduces hospitalization rates and shows milder symptoms, such as in those who have been vaccinated. As a result, many believe that Omicron provides a natural vaccination, which is the first step toward ending the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on published research and scientific evidence, we review and discuss how the end of this pandemic is predicted to occur as a result of Omicron variants being surpassed in the community. In light of the findings of our research, we believe that it is most likely true that the Omicron variant is a natural way of vaccinating the masses and slowing the spread of this deadly pandemic.

Available data suggest that endovascular repair is associated with lower perioperative 30-day all-cause mortality as well as a significant reduction in perioperative morbidity when compared to open surgery. Additionally, EVAR leads to decreased blood loss, eliminates the need for cross-clamping the aorta and has shorter recovery periods than traditional surgery. It is currently the preferred mode of treatment of thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms in a subset of patients who meet certain anatomic criteria conducive to endovascular repair. The main disadvantage of EVAR procedures is the high rate of post-procedural complications that often require secondary re-intervention. As a result, most authorities recommend lifelong imaging surveillance following repair. Available surveillance modalities include conventional radiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance angiography, ultrasonography, nuclear imaging and conventional angiography, with computed tomography currently considered to be the gold standard for surveillance by most experts. Following endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, the rate of complications is estimated to range between 16% and 30%. The complication rate is higher following thoracic EVAR (TEVAR) and is estimated to be as high as 38%. Common complications include both those related to the endograft device and systemic complications. Device-related complications include endoleaks, endograft migration or collapse, kinking and/or stenosis of an endograft limb and graft infection. Post-procedural systemic complications include end-organ ischemia, cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events and post-implantation syndrome. Secondary re-interventions are required in approximately 19% to 24% of cases following endovascular abdominal and thoracic aortic aneurysm repair respectively. Typically, most secondary reinterventions involve the use of percutaneous techniques such as placement of cuff extension devices, additional endograft components or stents, enhancement of endograft fixation, treatment of certain endoleaks using various embolization techniques and embolic agents and thrombolysis of occluded endograft components. Less commonly, surgical conversion and/or open surgical modification are required. In this article, we provide an overview of the most common complications that may occur following endovascular repair of thoracic and AAAs. We also summarize the current surveillance recommendations for detecting and evaluating these complications and discuss various current secondary re-intervention approaches that may typically be employed for treatment.",2018,"Daye, Dania; Walker, T Gregory",Cardiovascular diagnosis and therapy,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.21037/cdt.2017.09.17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29850426/,44073905.0

bxbshbr6,,WHO,Mouse Sertoli cells isolation by lineage tracing and sorting,,,,unk,"Sertoli cells play a key role in spermatogenesis by supporting the germ cells throughout differentiation. The isolation of Sertoli cells is essential to study their functions. However, the close contact of Sertoli cells with other testicular cell types and the high proliferation of contaminating cells are obstacles to obtain pure primary cultures. Current rodent Sertoli cell isolation protocols result in enriched, rather than pure Sertoli cells. Therefore, novel approaches are necessary to improve the purity of Sertoli cell primary cultures. The goal of this study is to obtain pure mouse Sertoli cells using lineage tracing and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). We bred the Amh-Cre mouse line with tdTomato line to generate mice constitutively expressing red fluorescence specifically in Sertoli cells. Primary cultures of Sertoli cells isolated from prepubertal mice showed that 79% of cells expressed tdTomato, as evaluated by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry; however, nearly all adherent cells were positive for vimentin. Most of the tomato-negative cells expressed &#945;-smooth muscle actin (&#945;-SMA), a peritubular myoid cell marker, but double-negative populations were also present. These findings suggest that vimentin lacks Sertoli cell-specificity and that &#945;-SMA is not adequate to identify all of the contaminating cells. Upon FACS sorting; however, virtually 100% of the cells were tdTomato positive, expressed vimentin, but not &#945;-SMA. Prepubertal mice yielded a higher number of Sertoli cells compared to adults, but both could be adequately sorted. In conclusion, our study shows that lineage tracing and sorting is an efficient strategy for acquiring pure populations of murine Sertoli cells.",2020,"Zomer, Helena D; Reddi, Prabhakara P",Mol. reprod. dev,,#32735067,,,,,220887464.0

We demonstrated the case series of thrombosis in Thai patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. One patient had the first case of a large left ventricular thrombus, and three other patients had pulmonary embolism. All patients were male and had low absolute lymphocyte count, while lactate dehydrogenase level and d‐dimer were markedly elevated, especially at the time when the thrombosis was diagnosed. All patients had severe COVID‐19 with pneumonia. Two patients who needed mechanical ventilation were successfully extubated. After hospitalization for 13‐49 days, pneumonia and thrombosis improved and all of them could be discharged from the hospital.

In this work bi-material fused deposition modeling 3D printing is utilized to construct an integrated platform based on a polyamide electrochemical cell and electrodes manufactured from a polylactic acid-carbon nanotube conductive composite. The cell contains separated compartments for the reference and counter electrode and enables reactants to be introduced and inspected under oxygen-free conditions. The developed platform was employed in an electrochemical study investigating the electrochemical oxidation of aqueous hydrazine coupled to its bulk reaction with carbon dioxide. The analysis of cyclic voltammograms obtained in reaction mixtures with systematically varied composition confirmed that the reaction between hydrazine and carbon dioxide follows 1/1 stoichiometry and the corresponding equilibrium constant amounts to (2.8 ± 0.6) × 10(3).

Telehealth visits allowed the continued care for outpatients and thus the preoperative screening for bariatric candidates. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of tele-screening on the multidisciplinary obesity team’s decision (MDD) for bariatric surgery: disapproval, direct approval, or a recommendation for a prehabilitation program. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hospital data were collected from patients who underwent face-to-face or tele-screening for bariatric surgery between April and December 2020. The tele-screening cohort was then compared with a propensity-matched cohort of patients with face-to-face consultations. A chi-square and multinomial logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: After propensity matching, 396 patients remained for analysis. The majority received preoperative prehabilitation advice in both the tele-screening and face-to-face group (51% versus 50%). Although not significant, there were more direct approvals and fewer denials in the face-to-face group (p = 0.691). The multinomial logistic regression analysis showed no significant impact of tele-screening on the MDD result. CONCLUSION: Tele-screening in bariatric centers is feasible; the multidisciplinary team’s decision was not significantly different between tele-screening and face-to-face screening which encourages the use of tele-screening in the future. An insignificant amount of fewer direct approvals and more denials were observed in the tele-screening group, which should be taken into account in future and larger case studies.

Little is known, at the country level, where and how patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) have been mostly affected. METHODS: Survey of the network of Nephrology centers using a simplified 17 items electronic questionnaire designed by Italian Society of Nephrology COVID-19 Research Group. We used spatial epidemiology and geographical information systems to map SARS-CoV-2 spread among RRT patients in Italy. RESULTS: On April 9th 2020, all nephrology centers (n = 454) listed in the DialMap database were invited to complete the electronic questionnaire. Within 11 days on average, 365 centers responded (80.4% response rate; 2.3% margin of error) totaling 60,441 RRT patients. The surveyed RRT population included 30,821 hemodialysis (HD), 4139 peritoneal dialysis (PD), and 25,481 transplanted (Tx) patients respectively. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positive RRT patients in Italy was 2.26% (95% CI 2.14–2.39) with significant differences according to treatment modality (p < 0.001). The proportion of patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 was significantly higher in HD (3.55% [95% CI 3.34–3.76]) than PD (1.38% [95% CI 1.04–1.78] and Tx (0.86% [95% CI 0.75–0.98]) (p < 0.001), with substantial heterogeneity across regions and along the latitude gradient (p < 0.001). In RRT patients the highest rate was in the north-west (4.39% [95% CI 4.11–4.68], followed by the north-east (IR 2.06% [1.79–2.36]), the center (0.91% [0.75–1.09]), the main islands (0.67% [0.47–0.93]), and the south (0.59% [0.45–0.75]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, among SARS-Cov-2 positive RRT patients the fatality rate was 32.8%, as compared to 13.3% observed in the Italian population as of April 23rd. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of the 60,441 surveyed RRT patients in Italy were SARS-Cov-2 positive and subsequently died during the exponential phase of COVID-19 pandemic. Infection risk and rates seems to differ substantially across regions, along geographical latitude, and by treatment modality.

Historically, the strongest stigmas related to diseases were characterized as highly transmittable, potentially lethal, and without remedy. All represented COVID-19 during the early transition into the new normal. We aimed to analyzed stigma and economic stressors concerning mental health. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of 1375 participants in Java, Indonesia. Mental health status evaluated with DASS-21. The presence of social and self-stigma related to Covid-19 assessed with a questionnaire developed based on seven domains of public stigma. Demographics and other psychosocial stressors were assessed with an online questionnaire. Descriptive analyses and logistic regression had carried out. Result: A very high percentage of perceived and anticipated self-stigma and social stigma revealed. Controlling demographics factors, clear self-stigma increased the risk for depression (2.323 (1.241-4.346), p<0.05), anxiety (2.134 (1.205-3.777), p<0.05) and stress 3.931 (1.779-8.685), P<0.001).

These approaches restrict the mobility, social interactions, and daily activities of the affected individuals. In recent novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, quarantine and isolation are being adopted in many contexts, which necessitates an evaluation of global evidence on how such measures impact the mental health outcomes among populations. This umbrella review aimed to synthesize the available evidence on mental health outcomes of quarantine and isolation for preventing infectious diseases.Materials and methods: We searched nine major databases and additional sources and included articles if they were systematically conducted reviews, published as peer-reviewed journal articles, and reported mental health outcomes of quarantine or isolation in any population. Results: Among 1364 citations, only eight reviews met our criteria. Most of the primary studies in those reviews were conducted in high-income nations and in hospital settings. These articles reported a high burden of mental health problems among patients, informal caregivers, and healthcare providers who experienced quarantine or isolation. Prevalent mental health problems among the affected individuals include depression, anxiety, mood disorders, psychological distress, posttraumatic stress disorder, insomnia, fear, stigmatization, low self-esteem, lack of self-control, and other adverse mental health outcomes.

The method of sample pooling and group test has recently been introduced and adopted. However, it is still not clearly known how to determine the appropriate group size. In this paper, we treat asymptomatic COVID-19 screening acceleration as an optimization problem, and solve the problem using an analytical approach and an algorithmic procedure. We develop a two-level hierarchical pooling strategy for accelerating asymptomatic COVID-19 screening. In the first level, a population is divided into groups, which results in inter-group acceleration. In the second level, a group is divided into subgroups, which results in intra-group and inter-subgroup acceleration. By using our analytical methods and numerical algorithms, we determine the optimal group size and the optimal subgroup size, which minimize the total number of tests, maximize the speedup of the hierarchical pooling strategy, and minimize both time and cost of testing. It is discovered that the optimal group size and the optimal subgroup size are determined by the fraction of infected people. Furthermore, the optimal group size, the optimal subgroup size, and the achieved speedup grow sublinearly with the reciprocal of the fraction of infected people. Our research has important social implications and financial impacts. For example, if the fraction of infected people is 0.01, by using group size of 25 and subgroup size of 5, we can achieve speedup of at least 11, which means that months of testing time can be reduced to days, and over 91% of the testing cost can be saved. Such results have not been available in the known literature.

On March 11, 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared NCOVID-19 as a pandemic. The Government of India (GOI) took several actions to control the spread of the pandemic in the country and issued several guidelines for public and organizations. The adversity caused by pandemic required continuity of electric supply to consumers. The latter was achieved through proper planning and execution. The Indian Power System Operator, POSOCO through its National and Regional Load Dispatch Centers (NLDC and RLDCs) assessed the situation early and took all planned efforts for the Indian power system operation which is essential for keeping 'lights ON' during these hours of crisis. Strategic team at the top management level and tactical teams at the individual control center level were formed to handle any unforeseen circumstances. This paper has discussed the various actions taken by POSOCO during NCOVID-19 scenario and impact of it on Indian power system. Impact of exceptional events as faced during pandemic period, like, Janata Curfew, Lights-Off event, Super Cyclonic Storms 'Amphan', 'Nisarga', and Solar eclipse is also discussed in the paper.

Internationally, cases in newborns are few and the outcomes, in general, are good. There is no certainty of possible vertical transmission, and the presence of the virus in human milk is improbable. The gold standard for diagnosis is the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. We performed a literature review and presented a case of perinatal COVID-19. Clinical case: We describe the case of a full-term male infant with a birth weight of 3450 g and history of rooming-in with another mother-baby pair, both positive for SARS-CoV-2. On the second day of life, the neonate developed pneumonia, with clinical, X-ray and ultrasound diagnostic confirmation. On the third day of life, RT-PCR was positive for SARS-CoV-2; the mother was also positive but remained asymptomatic. The patient required mechanical ventilation and was transferred to a tertiary level neonatal unit on day 5 of life, where congenital heart disease was ruled out. He evolved satisfactorily with a negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 on day 8 and was extubated and discharged on day 21 of life. Telephone follow-up was performed without complications. Conclusions: The present case was classified as horizontal transmission with a short incubation period of COVID-19.",2021,"Lima-Rogel, Victoria; Villegas-Silva, Raúl; Coronado-Zarco, Alejandra; Estrada-Ruelas, Isaac; Vega, Alma R Sánchez-De la; Muro-Flores, Raúl H; Villa-Guillén, Mónica",Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,,#1116363,,,,,232124534.0

hn0i01be,,WHO,Supporting interdependent telework employees: A moderated-mediation model linking daily COVID-19 task setbacks to next-day work withdrawal,,,,unk,"The COVID-19 crisis has compelled many organizations to implement full-time telework for their employees in a bid to prevent a transmission of the virus. At the same time, the volatile COVID-19 situation presents unique, unforeseen daily disruptive task setbacks that divert employees' attention from routinized work tasks and require them to respond adaptively and effortfully. Yet, little is known about how telework employees react to such complex demands and regulate their work behaviors while working from home. Drawing on Hobfoll's (1989) conservation of resources (COR) theory, we develop a multilevel, two-stage moderated-mediation model arguing that daily COVID-19 task setbacks are stressors that would trigger a resource loss process and will thus be positively related to the employee's end-of-day emotional exhaustion. The emotionally exhausted employee then enters a resource preservation mode that precipitates a positive relationship between end-of-day exhaustion and next-day work withdrawal behaviors. Based on COR, we also predict that the relation between daily COVID-19 task setbacks and exhaustion would be more positive in telework employees who have higher (vs. lower) task interdependence with coworkers, but organizations could alleviate the positive relation between end-of-day exhaustion and next-day work withdrawal behavior by providing employees with higher (vs. lower) telework task support. We collected daily experience-sampling data over 10 workdays from 120 employees (Level 1, n = 1,022) who were teleworking full-time due to the pandemic lockdown. The results generally supported our hypotheses, and their implications for scholars and managers during and beyond the pandemic are discussed.

METHODS: In the context of COVID-19 pandemic, this was an interim analysis of an ongoing prospective observational study of patients who were stable on rituximab for at least 6 months and who had a planned extended dosing interval of 24 months. Only data for patients with active RRMS before rituximab were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 177 patients receiving rituximab, 33 had RRMS and MRI activity before rituximab and at least 8 months of follow-up after the last infusion. The mean (SD) age was 40 (14) years, 25 were females, the mean disease duration was 10 (6.8) years, the mean annual relapse rate (ARR) before rituximab was 1.7 (1.3), and the median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score before rituximab was 4.5 (1–7). Before extended dosing, when rituximab was infused every 6 months, the mean (SD) ARR decreased to 0.04 (0.1) (p < 0.0001) and the EDSS score to 4 (0–7) (p = 0.04).

udef7art,,WHO,Cost-effectiveness of left ventricular assist devices as destination therapy in the United Kingdom,,,,unk,"AIMS: Continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) as destination therapy (DT) are a recommended treatment by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence England for end-stage heart failure patients ineligible for cardiac transplantation. Despite the fact that DT is frequently used as an LVAD indication across other major European countries and the United States, with consistent improvements in quality-of-life and longevity, National Health Service (NHS) England does not currently fund DT, mainly due to concerns over cost-effectiveness. On the basis of the recently published ENDURANCE Supplemental Trial studying DT patients, we assessed for the first time the cost-effectiveness of DT LVADs compared with medical management (MM) in the NHS England. METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a Markov multiple-state economic model using NHS cost data. LVAD survival and adverse event rates were derived from the ENDURANCE Supplemental Trial. MM survival was based on Seattle Heart Failure Model estimates in the absence of contemporary clinical trials for this population. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated over a lifetime horizon. A discount rate of 3.5% per year was applied to costs and benefits. Deterministic ICER was £46 207 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Costs and utilities were £204 022 and 3.27 QALYs for the LVAD arm vs. £77 790 and 0.54 QALYs for the MM arm. Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness of the primary analysis.

Due to the global lockdown, work, employment, businesses and the economic climate have been severely affected. It has generated stress among people from all sections of society, especially to workers who have been assigned to cater to healthcare service or those constrained to secure daily essential items. It is widely perceived that elderly or those affected by diabetes, hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases are prone to COVID-19. As per an ongoing survey, the initial data shows that the above-mentioned anxiety and stress cause insomnia, and has the considerable potential to weaken the immune system, the sole protection against the virus. OBJECTIVE This study focuses on the need of Yoga practice at work places and at home during the global lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY Literature was searched using PubMed and Google Scholar for COVID-19-related stress and anxiety at work and society due to the worldwide lockdown. The predisposing comorbidities, viral mechanism of action and treatment regimen were also searched. Yoga-based intervention studies and online programs were also searched. RESULTS As the lockdown cannot last forever and workplaces will have to be functional soon, there is an increased possibility of recurrent infection. Therefore, Yoga can provide the necessary tool for risk reduction, amelioration of stress and anxiety and strengthening of the immune function. The online platforms provide a good media for Yoga training at work places and homes. CONCLUSION Due to social distancing norms, the availability of Yoga trainers has become restricted. Yoga practice is actively sought to achieve reduced anxiety and stress so that improved sleep may positively impact immunity. As a consequence, there is a spurt in social media, catering to daily online Yoga sessions which apparently prove useful in providing accessible means to achieve mental as well as physical well-being.",2020-08-17,"Sharma, Kanupriya; Anand, Akshay; Kumar, Raj",Work,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-203219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32925134/,221724480.0

This study aimed to examine GP uptake on the online diabetes CME and its effectiveness on changes in the GPs’ attitudes and knowledge about Type 2 diabetes management.Methods: A cross-sectional study and a before-and-after study were employed with 279 GP trainees who voluntarily undertook the newly developed diabetes programme online. A follow-up survey was conducted 6 months after the GP trainees completed their training.Results: One hundred and twelve out of 279 GP trainees (40.1%) participated, of whom 37 (13.3%) enrolled in the online diabetes programme, and 20 (7.2%) completed the programme. The participants’ mean diabetes knowledge score before enrolling the programme was 61.5%. The participants’ confidence in effective insulin treatment increased significantly after the programme (95% Confident interval [CI], -0.51-0.00;P=0.05) but their knowledge scores before and after the programme were not statistically different (95% CI, -3.93-0.59;P=0.14).Conclusion: There was poor uptake for an online diabetes CME, even though effective recruitment strategies were employed, and while the online educational option is attractive and accessible during the COVID-19 pandemic. This present study emphasises not only the gap between evidence-based practice and actual GP practice but also a need for mandatory CME.Funding Information: This study was financially supported by the Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University (Grant no.

We aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of Mycobacterium vaccae nebulization in the treatment of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we included 31 adult patients with moderate COVID-19 who were admitted to the Fourth People's Hospital of Nanning (Nanning, China) between January 22, 2020 and February 17, 2020. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: group A (standard care group) and group B (M. vaccae in combination with standard care group). The primary outcome was the time interval from admission to viral RNA negative conversion (oropharyngeal swabs were used in this study). Secondary outcomes included chest computed tomography (CT), mortality, length of hospital stay, complications during treatment, and so on. Patients were followed up to 4 weeks after discharge (reexamination of viral RNA, chest CT, etc.). Results: Nucleic acid test negative conversion time in group B was shorter than that in group A (2.9 days [2.7-8.7] vs. 6.8 days [3.3-13.8]; p = 0.045). No death and no conversion to severe or critical cases were observed in both groups. Two weeks after discharge, neither ""relapse"" nor ""return to positive"" cases were found.

We quantified plasma immunoglobulin (Ig) and lymphocyte phenotypes among 31 pediatric heart and kidney recipients for two years post-transplant and from 10 non-transplanted children. METHODS Plasma IgM, IgG, and IgA were quantified by immunoturbidimetric assays, IgG subclasses were quantified by bead-based multiplex immunoassay, and lymphocyte phenotypes were assessed by flow cytometry. RESULTS Median age at transplant for SOT recipients was similar to that of the control cohort (15 vs. 12.5 years, respectively; p=0.61). Mean plasma IgG and IgM levels for SOT recipients fell significantly below the control cohort means by 1 month post-transplant (p<0.001 for both) and remained lower than control levels at 12-18 months post-transplant. Heart recipients had lower frequencies of CD45RA+CD4+ naïve T lymphocytes relative to kidney recipients. CONCLUSIONS Hypogammaglobulinemia was prevalent and persistent among pediatric SOT recipients and may be secondary to immunosuppressive medications, as well as loss of thymus tissue and CD45RA+CD4+ T cells in heart recipients.

In this period, the timely delivery of adequate emergency medical supplies to the epidemic points will play an important role in controlling the spread of the epidemic. However, the existing emergency medical supplies loading optimization model has not taken the initial period of the epidemic as the research time nor fully considered the traffic control situation in that period. Therefore, combined with the characteristics of the initial epidemic period of COVID-19, this study establishes an optimization model for emergency medical supplies stowage at the rescue point, considering the variation in demand for different kinds of medical supplies at the epidemic point in different cycles and the impact of traffic control on the mode of transportation. The model is an integer programming model. The objective function is the least total cost, including total transportation cost and total inventory cost. The constraints include the supply limit of each medical material that can be provided by the rescue point, the transportation capacity limit of the transportation mode, the demand constraints, inventory constraints, nonnegative constraints, and integer variable constraints of various medical supplies in each cycle of the epidemic location. Finally, combining the development of the epidemic situation in Wuhan January 18–23, 2020, a case study was carried out, and the optimal combination of different transportation modes and different stowage schemes in different periods of the rescue point was obtained, which verified the feasibility and practicality of the model. The model constructed in this study can provide a theoretical reference to the optimal decision-making plan of emergency medical supplies of the implementation of traffic control during the initial period of emergency public health events.

In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that early demyelination is due to directly virus-induced oligodendroglial changes. In the present spatiotemporal study in experimentally CDV-infected dogs we observed diffuse up-regulation of T cells throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and T cell invasion in early demyelinating lesions. Invasion of T cells in the CNS occurred despite severe immunosuppression and without any perivascular cuffing. However, the major fraction of invading T cells correlated with sites of viral replication and coincided with the demonstration of an early immune response against the nucleocapsid protein of CDV. Activation of microglial cells was thought to have elicited the migration of T cells to the CNS by secretion of chemokines: marked IL-8 activity was found in the CSF of dogs with acute lesions. In areas of early demyelination, large numbers of CD3(+) cells accumulated in the tissue in the absence of any morphological sign of inflammation. Whether the T cells at lesion sites contribute to the development of acute demyelination remains uncertain at this stage. Antiviral cytotoxicity was not apparent since viral clearance in demyelinating lesions is only effective when B cells and concurring antiviral antibody production appeared in the subacute and chronic inflammatory stage of the disease. CD3(+) cells appear to persist for several weeks after infection since they were also found in recovered dogs that did not develop demyelination. Accumulation of immune cells, including a significant proportion of resting T cells (CD45RA(+)) in the CNS in the early stages of the disease may facilitate the later development of the intrathecal immune response and associated immunopathological complications.",1999,"Tipold, A.; Moore, P.; Zurbriggen, A.; Burgener, I.; Barben, G.; Vandevelde, M.",Acta Neuropathol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/c84e7ee1a29558045ec9f608216b468fc1607af0.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9930894/,25306440.0

3sdk5ds9,,WHO,Cost benefit analysis of portable chest radiography through glass: Initial experience at a tertiary care centre during COVID-19 pandemic,,,,unk,"INTRODUCTION: Portable chest radiography through glass (TG-CXR) is a novel technique, particularly useful during the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic. The purpose of this study was to understand the cost and benefit of adopting TG-CXR in quantifiable terms. METHODS: Portable or bedside radiographs are typically performed by a team of two technologists. The TG-CXR method has the benefit of allowing one technologist to stay outside of the patient room while operating the portable radiography machine, reducing PPE use, decreasing the frequency of radiography machine sanitization and decreasing technologists' exposures to potentially infectious patients. The cost of implementing this technique during the current COVID-19 pandemic was obtained from our department's operational database. The direct cost of routinely used PPE and sanitization materials and the cost of the time taken by the technologists to clean the machine was used to form a quantitative picture of the benefit associated with TG-CXR technique. RESULTS: Technologists were trained on the TG-CXR method during a 15 min shift change briefing. This translated to a one-time cost of $424.88 USD. There was an average reduction of portable radiography machine downtime of 4 min and 48 s per study. The benefit of adopting the TG-CXR technique was $9.87 USD per patient imaged. This will result in a projected net cost savings of $51,451.84 USD per annum. CONCLUSION: Adoption of the TG-CXR technique during the COVID-19 pandemic involved minimal one-time cost, but is projected to result in a net-benefit of over $51,000 USD per annum in our emergency department.",2021,"Liu, Tian Yang; Rai, Archana; Ditkofsky, Noah; Deva, Djeven P; Dowdell, Timothy R; Ackery, Alun Duncan; Mathur, Shobhit",J Med Imaging Radiat Sci,,#covidwho-1171127,,,,,233175130.0

The extent to which ischemia contributes to ischemia/reperfusion injury has not been thoroughly studied. After careful evaluation of intestinal tissue following 30 min of ischemia, we noticed significant local mucosal injury in wild-type mice. This injury was drastically reduced in C3-deficient mice, suggesting C3 involvement. Depletion of circulating complement with cobra venom factor eliminated, as expected, injury recorded at the end of the reperfusion phase but failed to eliminate injury that occurred during the ischemic phase. Immunohistochemical studies showed that tissue damage during ischemia was associated with increased expression of C3/C3 fragments primarily in the intestinal epithelial cells, suggesting local involvement of complement. In vitro studies using Caco2 intestinal epithelial cells showed that in the presence of LPS or exposure to hypoxic conditions the cells produce higher C3 mRNA as well as C3a fragment. Caco2 cells were also noted to produce cathepsins B and L, and inhibition of cathepsins suppressed the release of C3a. Finally, we found that mice treated with a cathepsin inhibitor and cathepsin B-deficient mice suffer limited intestinal injury during the ischemic phase. To our knowledge, our findings demonstrate for the first time that significant intestinal injury occurs during ischemia prior to reperfusion and that this is due to activation of C3 within the intestinal epithelial cells in a cathepsin-dependent manner.

However, costs, logistics, and uncertainty about effectiveness are potential barriers to implementation. We assessed early data from the Massachusetts K-12 public school pooled SARS-CoV2 testing program, which incorporates two novel design elements: in-school ""pod pooling"" for assembling pools of dry anterior nasal swabs from 5 to 10 individuals and positive pool deconvolution using the BinaxNOW antigen rapid diagnostic test (Ag RDT), to assess the operational and analytical feasibility of this approach. Over 3 months, 187,597 individual swabs were tested across 39,297 pools from 738 schools. The pool positivity rate was 0.8%; 98.2% of pools tested negative and 0.2% inconclusive, and 0.8% of pools submitted could not be tested. Of 310 positive pools, 70.6% had an N1 or N2 probe cycle threshold (CT) value of &#8804;30. In reflex testing (performed on specimens newly collected from members of the positive pool), 92.5% of fully deconvoluted pools with an N1 or N2 target CT of &#8804;30 identified a positive individual using the BinaxNOW test performed 1 to 3 days later. However, of 124 positive pools with full reflex testing data available for analysis, 32 (25.8%) of BinaxNOW pool deconvolution testing attempts did not identify a positive individual, requiring additional reflex testing. With sufficient staffing support and low pool positivity rates, pooled sample collection and reflex testing were feasible for schools.

To inform vaccine distribution strategies that are aligned with public preferences for COVID-19 vaccination campaign features we conducted a survey and discrete choice experiment among a representative sample of 2,895 people in the US, between March 15 and March 22, 2021. We found that on average the public prioritized ease, preferring single to two dose vaccinations, vaccinating once rather than annually and reduced waiting times at vaccination sites - for some these were the primary preference drivers. Vaccine enforcement reduced overall vaccine acceptance, with a trend of increasing control aversion with increasing vaccine hesitancy, particularly among those who were young, Black/African American or Republican. These data suggest that making vaccination easy and promoting autonomy by offering the public choices of vaccination brands and locations may increase uptake, and that vaccine mandates could compromise autonomy and increase control aversion in those who are hesitant - reducing vaccination in such groups and potentially undermining the goals of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns.",2021-05-19,"Eshun-Wilson, I.; Mody, A.; Tram, K.

(Combretaceae) has been documented to exhibit therapeutic properties like cardiotonic, anticancer, antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, hypercholesterolemia, hypolipidemic, and anti-coagulant. Our previous studies have shown that, ethanolic extract of T. arjuna bark exhibits radical scavenging anti-oxidant activity and also effectively inhibited catalase activity. In this study, oleanane triterpenoids type compounds viz., oleanolic acid, arjunolic acid, arjunolitin, arjunetin were isolated from ethanolic bark extract as bio-active compound and their structures were elucidated using (1)H, (13)C NMR, HR-ESIMS, IR. Of the various compounds, Arjunetin showed significant inhibition of catalase activity as compared to the other compounds. Based on the structural similarity between arjunetin and current antiviral drugs, we propose that arjunetin might exhibit antiviral activity. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics studies showed that arjunetin binds to the binds to key targets of SARS-CoV-2 namely, 3CLpro, PLpro, and RdRp) with a higher binding energy values (3CLpro, −8.4 kcal/mol; PLpro, −7.6 kcal/mol and RdRp, −8.1 kcal/mol) as compared with FDA approved protease inhibitor drugs to Lopinavir (3CLpro, −7.2 kcal/mole and PLpro −7.7 kcal/mole) and Remdesivir (RdRp −7.6 kcal/mole). To further investigate this, we performed 200–500 ns molecular dynamics simulation studies. The results transpired that the binding affinity of Arjunetin is higher than Remdesivir in the RNA binding cavity of RdRp. Based on structural similarity between arjunetin and Saikosaponin (a known antiviral agents) and based on our molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation studies, we propose that arjunetin can be a promising drug candidate against Covid-19.

Despite this, the Bay of Bengal cyclone basin receives far less research attention than many of the others around the world. Here, we study the historical and future impacts of Super Cyclone Amphan, which made landfall in May 2020, bringing storm surges of 2-4 meters to coastlines of India and Bangladesh. Methods: In this modelling study, we combine projections of sea level rise from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Projection, phase 6 (CMIP6), with estimates of storm surge using a dynamic storm surge model. Sampling the spectrum of possible sea level rises, we consider a low, medium and high scenario, based on projections in 2100. We then feed these into a flood inundation model to simulate storm surge-induced flooding, had Cyclone Amphan occurred in these future worlds. Finally, we consider the change in future population growth and urbanisation, thereby calculating the change in population exposure to these future flooding events. Our approach is that of the extreme event attribution community, but projecting into the future rather than interrogating the past. Findings: We find that in 2100, the local sea level rise in the Bay of Bengal during the pre-monsoon cyclone season is between 0.32-0.84 m, depending on which emissions scenario is followed. If a Cyclone Amphan-scale storm surge occurred on top of that sea level rise, the future population of both India and Bangladesh will be more exposed, with India showing >200% increased exposure to extreme (>3 m) and moderate (>1 m) flooding under a high emissions scenario, and Bangladesh showing ~60-80% increased exposure to the same scenarios. The majority of this change in both countries comes from sea level rise rather than population changes, and in Bangladesh the future population change contributes negatively to the change in exposure, as more citizens migrate further inshore. However, if we follow an emissions scenario consistent with meeting the upper Paris Agreement climate goal, we project very little change in exposure. Interpretation: There is an urgent need to reduce carbon emissions to net zero, to prevent the negative impacts of climate change. By far the majority of cyclone research has been undertaken for countries such as America and Japan, with less resilient countries such as those in South Asia, which are more sensitive to changes in climate, seeing far less attention. With Cyclone Amphan occurring at the height of the COVID-19 crisis, we highlight how the risk was compounded and recommend that future climate risk assessments explicitly account for these potential non-linearities.

yoh0hdyc,,WHO,Nurses' burnout and associated risk factors during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis,,,,unk,"AIMS: To examine the nurses' burnout and associated risk factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: We followed the Cochrane criteria and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines for this systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Cochrane COVID-19 registry, CINAHL and pre-print services (medR&#967;iv and PsyArXiv) were searched from January 1 to November 15, 2020 and we removed duplicates. REVIEW METHODS: We applied a random effect model to estimate pooled effects since the heterogeneity between results was very high. RESULTS: Sixteen studies, including 18,935 nurses met the inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of emotional exhaustion was 34.1%, of depersonalization was 12.6% and of lack of personal accomplishment was 15.2%. The main risk factors that increased nurses' burnout were the following: younger age, decreased social support, low family and colleagues readiness to cope with COVID-19 outbreak, increased perceived threat of Covid-19, longer working time in quarantine areas, working in a high-risk environment, working in hospitals with inadequate and insufficient material and human resources, increased workload and lower level of specialized training regarding COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Nurses experience high levels of burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic, while several sociodemographic, social and occupational factors affect this burnout. IMPACT: We found that burnout among nurses is a crucial issue during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need to prepare nurses to cope better with COVID-19 pandemic. Identification of risk factors for burnout could be a significant weapon giving nurses and health care systems the ability to response in a better way against the following COVID-19 waves in the near future.",2021,"Galanis, Petros; Vraka, Irene; Fragkou, Despoina; Bilali, Angeliki; Kaitelidou, Daphne",J. adv. nurs,,#1150150,,,,,227153998.0
kpsanhfj,,WHO,Leveraging Technology for Remote Learning in the Era of COVID-19 and Social Distancing: Tips and Resources for Pathology Educators and Trainees,,,,unk,"The ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly disrupted traditional modes of operation in healthcare and education. In March 2020, institutions in the United States began to implement a range of policies to discourage direct contact and encourage social distancing. These measures have placed us in an unprecedented position where education can no longer occur at close quarters - most notably, around a multi-headed microscope - but must instead continue at a distance. This guide is intended to be a resource for pathologists and pathologists-in-training who wish to leverage technology to continue collaboration, teaching, and education in this era. The manuscript is focused mainly on anatomic pathology; however, the technologies easily lend themselves to clinical pathology education as well. Our aim is to provide curated lists of various online resources that can be used for virtual learning in pathology, provide tips and tricks, and share our personal experience with these technologies. The lists include video conferencing platforms, pathology websites, free online educational resources, including social media, and whole-slide imaging collections. We are currently living through a unique situation without a precedent or guidebook, and we hope that this guide will enable the community of pathology educators worldwide to embrace the opportunities that 21st century technology provides.",2020,"Mukhopadhyay, Sanjay; Booth, Adam L; Calkins, Sarah M; Doxtader, Erika E; Fine, Samson W; Gardner, Jerad M; Gonzalez, Raul S; Mirza, Kamran M; Jiang, Xiaoyin Sara",Arch. pathol. lab. med.

Of all social groups, adolescents are among the most vulnerable to social exclusion, which can interfere with their social development. Consequently, the evaluation of this construct in adolescents is an important matter. The aim of this investigation was to develop the Social Inclusion for Adolescents Scale (SIAS). Firstly, five psychosocial factors were proposed, which potentially contribute to social inclusion: (1) covered needs, (2) self-efficacy, (3) social support, (4) job training, and (5) social integration. From these five factors, a set of items was created and reduced using qualitative evaluations. The final set of items was used in three studies, with a Spanish population (N = 1540) and a foreign population (N = 460), to test the psychometric properties of the scale, its dimensional structure, the measurement invariance between Spanish and foreign people, the reliability of the instrument and the evidence of the validity of its measurements. The results indicate that this scale is psychometrically reliable enough to assess social inclusion in adolescents.

Remdesivir was reported by World Health Organization (WHO) as the most promising drug currently available for the treatment of COVID-19. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations and free energy perturbation methods to study the inhibition mechanism of remdesivir to its target SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). In the absence of a crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, we first construct the homology model of this polymerase based on a previously available structure of SARS-CoV NSP12 RdRp (with a sequence identify of 95.8%). We then build the putative binding mode by aligning the remdesivir + RdRp complex to the ATP bound poliovirus RdRp. The putative binding structure is further optimized with molecular dynamics simulations and demonstrated to be stable, indicating a reasonable binding mode for remdesivir. The relative binding free energy of remdesivir is calculated to be -8.28 ±0.65 kcal/mol, much stronger than the natural substrate ATP (-4.14 ±0.89 kcal/mol) which is needed for the polymerization. The ~800-fold improvement in the Kd from remdesivir over ATP indicates an effective replacement of APT in blocking of the RdRp binding pocket. Key residues D618, S549 and R555 are found to be the contributors to the binding affinity of remdesivir. These findings demonstrate that remdesivir can potentially act as a SARS-CoV-2 RNA-chain terminator, effectively stopping its RNA reproduction, with key residues also identified for future lead optimization and/or drug resistance studies.",2020,"Zhang, Leili Zhou Ruhong",,,#ppcovidwho-325090,,,,https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202003.0267.v1,216499005.0
52kgji6j,,WHO,Supporting lives lived whilst protecting lives saved during COVID-19: The relational invariant in person-centred care,,,,unk,"There has been an impressive development of nursing knowledge around the ethics, principles, frameworks, models and practices of person-centred care over the last 15 years, with colleagues from the Nordic countries making significant contributions to global knowledge across the discipline of nursing and beyond. A disciplinary challenge remains to map the variability in person-centred care with an aim to empirically clarify the invariant in person-centred care. Based on current research and practice, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, this article argues that the relational aspect of person-centred care is such an invariant, building on the socially constructive notion of ‘personhood’ being a standing or status that is bestowed on one human being by another in the context of relationship and social being. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, several of the key determinants of person-centred care are under threat due to health service responses and/or infection control measures, such as keeping older adults safe, imposing relationship restrictions, social distancing and isolation (or the lack thereof). Clinical examples from an Australian health service are used to show how recognizing the relational invariant of person-centred aged care facilitated supporting lives lived whilst also protecting lives saved. The relational invariant to person-centred care is who we are, constructed or deconstructed by and with others; something that may have become more visible through the relational restrictions imposed due to COVID-19. Protecting relationality in life and care and advocating for both safe and person-centred care for those who need it most is now more important than ever.",2020,"Edvardsson, David; Baxter, Rebecca; Birkett, Peter; Dunlop, Andrea",Nordic J.

Visual information is an indispensable part of our life and tends to convey a lot more details than either speech or text. A visual portrayal of a story is generally more appealing and convincing. It is also useful in a variety of applications, such as an accident/crime scene analysis, education and treatment of various psychological or mental disorders like Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Some individuals develop PTSD due to their exposure to some dangerous or shocking life experience, such as military conflict, physical or sexual assault, traffic or fire accident, natural disasters, etc. People suffering from PTSD can be treated using Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET), where they are immersed in a virtual environment to face feared situations that may not be safe to encounter in real life. In addition, generated 3D scenes can also be used as a visual aid for teaching children. Since crating 3D context and scenarios for such situations is tedious, time-consuming and requires special expertise in 3D application development environments and software, there is a need for automatic 3D scene generation systems from simple text descriptions. In this paper, we present a new framework for creating 3D scenes from a user-provided simple text. This proposed framework allows us to incorporate motion as well as special effects into the created scenes. In particular, the framework extracts the objects and entities that are present in a given textual narrative as well as spatial relationships. Depending on the description, it then creates either a 3D scene or a 3D scene with corresponding animation. This framework allows creation of a visualization using a set of pre-existing objects using [Formula: see text] as an implementation environment.",2021-02-22,"Ahmad, Imran Shafiq; Kadiyala, Havish; Boufama, Boubakeur",Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7591d7a161da44fc5e75c4af739e34e4db3ab89d.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7971977.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971977/,

A beta‐Poisson dose–response model with the N (50) parameter modified by an exponential‐inverse‐power time dependency or an exponential dose–response model with the k parameter modified by an exponential‐inverse time dependency provided a statistically adequate fit to the observed survival data.

Detectable autoantibodies were present in 30% of the patients in our cohort, with the majority of reactive specimens demonstrating antibodies to nuclear antigens. However, antinuclear antibodies were only weakly reactive and directed to single antigens, as is often seen during acute infection. We identified strongly reactive antibodies to nuclear antigens only in patients with a prior history of autoimmune disease.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to document what has occurred, and been reported, to child helplines during the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The study entailed primary data collection from child helplines and a search of media articles and news stories. METHODS: Child helplines submitted data on the contacts received during the first six months of 2020. Data on contacts related to violence were also available from 2019, and used as baseline. The media search used a combination of search terms to identify relevant articles and news stories published between March 1 st and June 17 th 2020. RESULTS: Overall, the number of contacts to helplines seems to have drastically increased since the beginning of the pandemic. However, the number of contacts related to violence has increased in some countries, while it decreased in others. CONCLUSIONS: While a mixed picture emerges with respect to violence, the increase in overall contacts made to helplines provides evidence that such services are a critical lifeline for many children and women during times of crisis.

Studies revealed that the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) increased under this condition. PTSD can change the structure of patients' central nervous system, and increase the risk of anxiety or depression, thus greatly affecting the quality of patients' life and their families. PTSD is preventable, and the effects of early prevention are better. Non-drug intervention can prevent or reduce the psychological sequelae after hospitalization, help patients understand the experience during hospitalization, and be beneficial to their psychological rehabilitation. Whether smartphone app based intervention can be an alternative therapy for PTSD in terms of COVID-19 convalescent patients is still controversial. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis and systematic review to evaluate the effects of smartphone app based intervention on PTSD in COVID-19 convalescent patients, so as to provide some guidance for clinical application. METHODS: The literatures that are related to the smartphone app based intervention and PTSD in COVID-19 convalescent patients from inception to February 2021 will be searched. The following databases are our focused areas: ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials repositories, PubMed, EmBase, and Web of Science databases. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 2 investigators would independently screen the literature extract data and evaluate the risk of bias in the included studies. Meta-analysis was performed with RevMan5.3 software. RESULTS: The results of this meta-analysis will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication.

In order to deal with the health emergency, in early March 2020, the Italian government enforced strict lockdown measures. The different Italian police forces, the Polizia di Stato, Carabinieri and city police forces (Polizia Municipale), patrolled the streets, ensuring that people stayed at home and non-essential shops remained closed. These police forces received unprecedented support from the public in enforcing lockdown. People were active in their neighbourhoods, taking pictures of alleged violators and reporting them to the police, as well as posting pictures of those violating the rules on social networks. Local administrators encouraged citizens to report lockdown violations and in the case of Rome, introduced an online reporting system. This article focuses on the policing of lockdown in Italy. The article develops the argument that public attitudes, defined as policing from below, combined with policing from above by local administrators, produced a populist policing of the lockdown. Qualitative methodology is used to discuss interviews with police officers and analyse newspaper articles. Populist political forces are hegemonising in Italy, relying on the feelings of insecurity that the virus has embittered. Populist hegemony strongly influenced the policing of problems related to COVID. The lack of community policing or plural policing models within the organisation of Italian police forces, which remain a combination of continental and colonial models, has been decisive in the development of populist policing. The consequence of this is a type of 'policing on demand', with the public providing the police with intelligence and demanding enforcement.

This study is the first to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of yoga within a weight management program following WL treatment. METHODS: 60 women with overweight or obesity (34.3±3.9 kg/m(2), 48.1±10.1 years) were randomized to receive a 12-week yoga intervention (2x/week; YOGA) or a structurally equivalent control (cooking/nutrition classes; CON), following a 3-month behavioral WL program. Feasibility (attendance, adherence, retention) and acceptability (program satisfaction ratings) were assessed. Treatment groups were compared on weight change, mindfulness, distress tolerance, stress, affect, and self-compassion at 6 months. Initial WL (3-mo WL) was evaluated as a potential moderator. RESULTS: Attendance, retention, and program satisfaction ratings of yoga were high. Treatment groups did not differ on WL or psychological constructs (with exception of one mindfulness subscale) at 6 months. However, among those with high initial WL (≥5%), YOGA lost significantly more weight (-9.0kg vs. -6.7kg) at 6 months and resulted in greater distress tolerance, mindfulness, and self-compassion and lower negative affect, compared to CON.

METHODS: This study extracted official data on COVID-19 from various official websites, summarized the policies in place in the United States and India, and evaluated the effectiveness of their policies. RESULTS: The United States has adopted a series of mitigation strategies to control the two waves of epidemic, including strengthening virus detection, calling on the people to wear masks and so on. As of May 30, 2021, although the daily new cases there decreased to some extent, the effect was not ideal. The US’s daily new cases ranked fourth and the cumulative number of confirmed cases ranked first in the world. India has adopted containment strategies in the initial stage of the outbreak, making the epidemic relatively stable. In the later stage, India has turned to adopt mitigation strategies. In addition, many factors including the lack of medical resources and premature relaxation measures led to the rapid deterioration of the epidemic situation. As of May 30, 2021, although the daily new cases in India has a downward trend, it ranked first in the world, and the cumulative number of confirmed cases ranked second. CONCLUSION: There are differences between the epidemic prevention strategies adopted by the United States and India, especially India’s containment strategies which helped it better control the epidemic in the early stage. However, the epidemic in the two countries is still severe. With the advent of virus mutants and the absence of immune barriers, it is meaningful that the two countries continue to take non-pharmacotherapy intervention measures and accelerate vaccination, according to specific national conditions adopt containment strategies that can control the epidemic more quickly when necessary, and pay attention to the risk of epidemic rebound caused by premature relaxation of epidemic prevention policies.",2022-04-29,"Yang, Junyan; Shi, Leiyu; Chen, Haiqian; Wang, Xiaohan; Jiao, Jun; Yang, Manfei; Liu, Meiheng; Sun, Gang",Int J Equity Health,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/c42e700de25b035453fe5b9136833fc9932daf11.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC9053837.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-022-01666-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35488277/,248436108.0

Here we apply a local drug delivery strategy to combat local lung cancer recurrence after resection using non-woven, biodegradable nanofiber meshes loaded with cisplatin. The meshes are fabricated using a scalable electrospinning process from two biocompatible polymers--polycaprolactone and poly(glycerol monostearate-co-caprolactone)--to afford favorable mechanical properties for use in a dynamic tissue such as the lung. Owing to their rough nanostructure and hydrophobic polymer composition, these meshes exhibit superhydrophobicity, and it is this non-wetting nature that sustains the release of cisplatin in a linear fashion over ∼90 days, with anti-cancer efficacy demonstrated using an in vitro Lewis Lung carcinoma (LLC) cell assay. The in vivo evaluation of cisplatin-loaded superhydrophobic meshes in the prevention of local cancer recurrence in a murine model of LLC surgical resection demonstrated a statistically significant increase (p = 0.0006) in median recurrence-free survival to >23 days, compared to standard intraperitoneal cisplatin therapy of equivalent dose.

Naïve CD8 T lymphocytes are normally resting and circulate between the blood and secondary lymphoid organs in search of their cognate peptide–MHC complexes. During viral infections, bone marrow–derived professional antigen-presenting cells (pAPCs) in secondary lymphoid organs display viral peptides on their MHC I molecules. Specific CD8 T lymphocytes that recognize these peptide–MHC adducts become activated (primed), proliferate extensively, and develop into effectors capable of killing infected cells, identified by the presence at their surface of the pertinent viral peptide–MHC complexes.

Evidence-based electronic clinical decision support (CDS) for management of these children may improve patient safety and decrease resource use. To guide these efforts, we evaluated the sociotechnical environment impacting the implementation of electronic CDS, including workflow and communication, institutional culture, and hardware and software infrastructure, among other factors. METHODS: Between March and May, 2020 semi-structured qualitative focus group interviews were conducted to identify sociotechnical influences on CDS implementation. Physicians from neurosurgery, emergency medicine, critical care, and pediatric general surgery were included, along with information technology specialists. Participants were recruited from nine health centers in the United States. Focus group transcripts were coded and analyzed using thematic analysis. The final themes were then cross-referenced with previously defined sociotechnical dimensions. RESULTS: We included 28 physicians and four information technology specialists in seven focus groups (median five participants per group). Five physicians were trainees and 10 had administrative leadership positions. Through inductive thematic analysis, we identified five primary themes: (1) clinical impact; (2) stakeholders and users; (3) tool content; (4) clinical practice integration; and (5) post-implementation evaluation measures. Participants generally supported using CDS to determine an appropriate level-of-care for these children. However, some had mixed feelings regarding how the tool could best be used by different specialties (e.g. use by neurosurgeons versus non-neurosurgeons). Feedback from the interviews helped refine the tool content and also highlighted potential technical and workflow barriers to address prior to implementation. CONCLUSIONS: We identified key factors impacting the implementation of electronic CDS for children with MHT and intracranial injuries. These results have informed our implementation strategy and may also serve as a template for future efforts to implement health information technology in a multidisciplinary, emergency setting.

Decomposition-Residuals Deep Neural Networks (DR-DNN) are hybrid point-forecasting models that can provide more accurate electricity demand predictions than single models within the COVID-19 era. DR-DNN is a novel two-layer hybrid architecture with: a decomposition and a nonlinear layer. Based on statistical tests, decomposition applies robust signal extraction and filtering of input data into: trend, seasonal and residuals signals. Utilizing calendar information, temporal signals are added: sinusoidal day/night cycles, weekend/weekday, etc. The nonlinear layer learns unknown complex patterns from all those signals, with the usage of well-established deep neural networks. DR-DNN outperformed baselines and state-of-the-art deep neural networks on next-day electricity forecasts within the COVID-19 era (from September 2020 to February 2021), both with fixed and Bayesian optimized hyperparameters. Additionally, model interpretability is improved, by indicating which endogenous or exogenous inputs contribute the most to specific hour-ahead forecasts. Residual signals are very important on the first hour ahead, whereas seasonal patterns on the 24th. Some calendar features also ranked high: whether it is day or night, weekend or weekday and the hour of the day. Temperature was the most important exogenous factor.

tjwtgyr8,,WHO,Transfer Factor: Myths and Facts,,,,unk,"Transfer factor (TF), also called ""Lawrence transfer factor"", or dialyzable leukocyte extract (DLE), has been used since the mid-twentieth century to transfer specific skin hypersensitivity through the injection of leukocytes from immunized donors to animals and humans. The main mechanism of action of TF has been suggested at the level of cell-mediated immunity, as it induces the production of migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and interferon gamma (IFN-Î³). Otherwise, TF can inhibit nuclear factor &#954;-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-&#954;B), and decrease tumoral necrosis factor &#945; (TNF-&#945;) and IL-4 levels. Given these biological effects, TF has been prescribed for a wide variety of conditions including infections, allergies, autoimmunity, and cancer, with inconsistent results. The exact nature of TF, however, remains unknown, so it has been impossible to accurately define its pharmacokinetics or dosage. This is further complicated because researchers have used TF in a variety of ways across the different studies: antigen-specific or non-antigen-specific, orally or subcutaneously administered, human and non-human origin. In this review we summarize the most important data about what TF is, its mechanism of action, how it is produced, its biological effects, and the available clinical trials using it, in order to establish its role and potential clinical applications in modern medicine.",2020,"Macias, Alejandro E; Guaní-Guerra, Eduardo",Arch. med. res,,#644327,,,,,220501384.0
icsp3re2,,WHO,Genome-Wide Analysis of Codon Usage Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 Virus Reveals Global Heterogeneity of COVID-19,,,,unk,"The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease COVID-19 is significantly implicated by global heterogeneity in the genome organization of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The causative agents of global heterogeneity in the whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 are not well characterized due to the lack of comparative study of a large enough sample size from around the globe to reduce the standard deviation to the acceptable margin of error. To better understand the SARS-CoV-2 genome architecture, we have performed a comprehensive analysis of codon usage bias of sixty (60) strains to get a snapshot of its global heterogeneity. Our study shows a relatively low codon usage bias in the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome globally, with nearly all the over-preferred codons' A.U. ended. We concluded that the SARS-CoV-2 genome is primarily shaped by mutation pressure; however, marginal selection pressure cannot be overlooked. Within the A/U rich virus genomes of SARS-CoV-2, the standard deviation in G.C. (42.91% ± 5.84%) and the GC3 value (30.14% ± 6.93%) points towards global heterogeneity of the virus. Several SARS-CoV-2 viral strains were originated from different viral lineages at the exact geographic location also supports this fact. Taking all together, these findings suggest that the general root ancestry of the global genomes are different with different genome's level adaptation to host. This research may provide new insights into the codon patterns, host adaptation, and global heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2.",2021,"Khattak, Saadullah; Rauf, Mohd Ahmar; Zaman, Qamar; Ali, Yasir; Fatima, Shabeen; Muhammad, Pir; Li, Tao; Khan, Hamza Ali; Khan, Azhar Abbas; Ngowi, Ebenezeri Erasto; Wu, Dong-Dong; Ji, Xin-Ying",Biomolecules,,#covidwho-1273388,,,,,235652759.0

Angiopoietins, vascular-specific growth factors, are linked to endothelial barrier dysfunction, and elevated Angiopoietin-2 (ANG2) levels are associated with poor outcome of ALI patients. Specialized immune cells, referred to as ‘TIE2-expressing monocytes and macrophages’ (TEM), were shown to specifically respond to ANG2 binding. However, their involvement in acute inflammatory processes is so far completely undescribed. Thus, our aim was to assess the dynamics of TEMs in a murine model of ALI. RESULTS: Intratracheal instillation of LPS induced a robust pulmonary pro-inflammatory response with endothelial barrier dysfunction and significantly enhanced ANG2 expression. The percentage number of TEMs, assessed by FACS analysis, was more than trebled compared to controls, with TEM count in lungs reaching more than 40% of all macrophages. Such distinct dynamic was absent in all other analyzed compartments (alveolar space, spleen, blood). Incubation of the monocytic cell line THP-1 with LPS or TNF-α resulted in a dose-dependent, significant upregulation of TIE2, suggesting that not recruitment from extra-pulmonary compartments but TIE2 upregulation in resident macrophages accounts for increased lung TEM frequencies. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, our data provide evidence that the activity of TEMs changes at sites of acute inflammation.

It was previously thought to be the main technique for improving cough efficacy, which aids in weaning from mechanical ventilation and improves patient outcomes. So, we selected randomly the odd numbers from Abo El-Reesh hospital records, and 30 children of both sexes with pneumonia were selected, aged from 6 months to 3 years, who were selected from intensive care unit: fifteen children were the control group, who received the selected physical therapy program (postural drainage, percussion and resist diaphragm), and another fifteen children were the study group, who received previous physical therapy program, which was selected, and cough assist device. RESULTS: This study revealed the effect of cough assist device on blood gasses and the period of mechanical ventilator on children with pneumonia and general hypotonia. There was a significant decrease in pH, PaCO(2), and HCO(3) post treatment compared with that pretreatment in the study and control groups (p < 0.05). The percentage of decrease in pH, PaCO(2), and HCO(3) in study group A were 0.4, 38.26, and 30.28% respectively while that in the control group were 0.4, 32.56, and 25.48% for pH, PaCO(2), and HCO(3) respectively. There was a significant increase in PaO(2) post treatment compared with that pretreatment in the study and control groups (p < 0.001). The percentage of increase in PaO(2) in the study group was 32.13% and that in control group was 30.09%. There was no significant difference in pH, PaCO(2), and HCO(3) between both groups pre-treatment (p ˃ 0.05). Also, there was no significant difference between groups post treatment (p ˃ 0.05).

SD may thus serve as a real-time mechanistic biomarker for impending parenchyma damage in patients during neurocritical care. Using subdural platinum/iridium (Pt/Ir) electrodes, SD is observed as a large negative direct current (DC) shift. Besides SD, there are other causes of DC shifts that are not to be confused with SD. Here, we systematically analyzed DC artifacts in ventilated patients by observing changes in the fraction of inspired oxygen. For the same change in blood oxygenation, we found that negative and positive DC shifts can simultaneously occur at adjacent Pt/Ir electrodes. METHODS: Nurses and intensivists typically increase blood oxygenation by increasing the fraction of inspired oxygen at the ventilator before performing manipulations on the patient. We retrospectively identified 20 such episodes in six patients via tissue partial pressure of oxygen (p(ti)O(2)) measurements with an intracortical O(2) sensor and analyzed the associated DC shifts. In vitro, we compared Pt/Ir with silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) to assess DC responses to changes in pO(2), pH, or 5-min square voltage pulses and investigated the effect of electrode polarization on pO(2)-induced DC artifacts. RESULTS: Hyperoxygenation episodes started from a p(ti)O(2) of 37 (30–40) mmHg (median and interquartile range) reaching 71 (50–97) mmHg. During a total of 20 episodes on each of six subdural Pt/Ir electrodes in six patients, we observed 95 predominantly negative responses in six patients, 25 predominantly positive responses in four patients, and no brain activity changes. Adjacent electrodes could show positive and negative responses simultaneously. In vitro, Pt/Ir in contrast with Ag/AgCl responded to changes in either pO(2) or pH with large DC shifts. In response to square voltage pulses, Pt/Ir falsely showed smaller DC shifts than Ag/AgCl, with the worst performance under anoxia. In response to pO(2) increase, Pt/Ir showed DC positivity when positively polarized and DC negativity when negatively polarized. CONCLUSIONS: The magnitude of pO(2)-induced subdural DC shifts by approximately 6 mV was similar to that of SDs, but they did not show a sequential onset at adjacent recording sites, could be either predominantly negative or positive in contrast with the always negative DC shifts of SD, and were not accompanied by brain activity depression. Opposing polarities of pO(2)-induced DC artifacts may result from differences in baseline electrode polarization or subdural p(ti)O(2) inhomogeneities relative to subdermal p(ti)O(2) at the quasi-reference.

DESIGN: Retrospective description, analysis and discussion of the factors and their contribution. SETTING: Single-institution study. METHODS: We describe and discuss the healthcare policies, infrastructure, people and processes contributing to the low COVID-19 infectivity rate in SHP. There were 1212 full-time and 198 contract staff. Of these, 171 SHP employees also supported the work in dormitories, isolation and community care facilities. During the review period, healthcare workers (HCWs) in SHP managed about 867 076 patient attendances, including 63 503 for upper respiratory tract infections, across its cluster of eight polyclinics. 29 642 swabs for COVID-19 were performed in SHP, with 126 positive results. 395 swabs were carried out in the dormitories and 59 were positive. Despite the high exposure, only two SHP staff were infected with COVID-19. Both have recovered well. RESULTS: Provision of adequate personal protection equipment, zonal segregation of high-risk patients, reduction in physical patient visits, effective staff communication, implementation of self-declared temperature monitoring and the maintenance of sustainable workload and work hours of HCWs contributed to the mitigation of COVID-19 infection risk among our staff.

Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a large glycosaminoglycan abundant in mammalian tissues that has been shown to enhance biofilm formation in multiple Gram-positive pathogens. We observed that HA accumulated in an S. aureus biofilm infection using a murine implant-associated infection model and that HA levels increased in a mutant strain lacking hyaluronidase (HysA). S. aureus secretes HysA in order to cleave HA during infection. Through in vitro biofilm studies with HA, the hysA mutant was found to accumulate increased biofilm biomass compared to the wild type, and confocal microscopy showed that HA is incorporated into the biofilm matrix. Exogenous addition of purified HysA enzyme dispersed HA-containing biofilms, while catalytically inactive enzyme had no impact. Additionally, induction of hysA expression prevented biofilm formation and also dispersed an established biofilm in the presence of HA. These observations were corroborated in the implant model, where there was decreased dissemination from an hysA mutant biofilm infection compared to the S. aureus wild type. Histopathology demonstrated that infection with an hysA mutant caused significantly reduced distribution of tissue inflammation compared to wild-type infection. To extend these studies, the impact of HA and S. aureus HysA on biofilm-like aggregates found in joint infections was examined. We found that HA contributes to the formation of synovial fluid aggregates, and HysA can disrupt aggregate formation. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that HA is a relevant component of the S. aureus biofilm matrix and HysA is important for dissemination from a biofilm infection.",2016,"Ibberson, Carolyn B; Parlet, Corey P; Kwiecinski, Jakub; Crosby, Heidi A; Meyerholz, David K; Horswill, Alexander R",Infection and immunity,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1128/iai.01418-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27068096/,4772696.0

METHODS: A large group of Italian urologists directly involved in the reorganization of their urological wards during the first and second phase of the pandemic agreed on a set of updated recommendations for current urology practice. RESULTS: The updated recommendations included strategies for the prioritization of both surgical and outpatient activities, implementation of perioperative pathways for patients scheduled for elective surgery, management of urological conditions in infected patients. Future scenarios with possible implementation of telehealth and reshaping of clinical practice following the effects of vaccination are also discussed.

DESIGN: We collected and sequenced 392 tongue-coating samples, 172 faecal samples and 155 serum samples from Central China and East China. We characterised microbiome and lipid molecules, constructed microbial classifiers in discovery cohort and verified their diagnostic potential in 74 confirmed patients (CPs) from East China and 37 suspected patients (SPs) with IgG positivity. RESULTS: Oral and faecal microbial diversity was significantly decreased in CPs versus healthy controls (HCs). Compared with HCs, butyric acid-producing bacteria were decreased and lipopolysaccharide-producing bacteria were increased in CPs in oral cavity. The classifiers based on 8 optimal oral microbial markers (7 faecal microbial markers) achieved good diagnostic efficiency in different cohorts. Importantly, diagnostic efficacy reached 87.24% in the cross-regional cohort. Moreover, the classifiers successfully diagnosed SPs with IgG antibody positivity as CPs, and diagnostic efficacy reached 92.11% (98.01% of faecal microbiome). Compared with CPs, 47 lipid molecules, including sphingomyelin (SM)(d40:4), SM(d38:5) and monoglyceride(33:5), were depleted, and 122 lipid molecules, including phosphatidylcholine(36:4p), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)(16:0p/20:5) and diglyceride(20:1/18:2), were enriched in confirmed patients recovery.

We aimed to investigate the odds of developing severe COVID-19 in health and shift workers. METHODS: We included UK Biobank participants in employment or self-employed at baseline (2006–2010) and with linked COVID-19 data to 31st August 2020. Participants were grouped as neither a health worker nor shift worker (reference category) at baseline, health worker only, shift worker only, or both, and associations with severe COVID-19 investigated in logistic regressions. RESULTS: Of 235,685 participants (81·5% neither health nor shift worker, 1·4% health worker only, 16·9% shift worker only, and 0·3% both), there were 580 (0·25%) cases of severe COVID-19. The odds of severe COVID-19 was higher in health workers (adjusted odds ratio: 2·32 [95% CI: 1·33, 4·05]; shift workers (2·06 [1·72, 2·47]); and in health workers who worked shifts (7·56 [3·86, 14·79]). Being both a health worker and a shift worker had a possible greater impact on the odds of severe COVID-19 in South Asian and Black and African Caribbean ethnicities compared to White individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Both health and shift work (measured at baseline, 2006–2010) were independently associated with over twice the odds of severe COVID-19 in 2020; the odds were over seven times higher in health workers who work shifts. Vaccinations, therapeutic and preventative options should take into consideration not only health and key worker status but also shift worker status.

Nevertheless, these vaccines are far from perfect where their efficiency ranges from 65 to 90%; therefore, vaccines are not the one only solution to overcome this situation, and apart from administration of vaccines, the scientific community is at quest for finding alternative solutions to incumber SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, our research group is keen on identifying a bioactive molecule that is independent in its mode of action from existing vaccines which can potentially target the SARS-CoV-2 virus replicative efficacy. Papain-like protease (PLpro) and main protease (Mpro) are the most lucrative targets of COVIDs against which the drugs can be developed, as these proteases play a vital role in the replication and development of viral particles. Researchers have modelled a compound such as GRL0617 and X77 as an inhibitor of Mpro and PLpro, respectively, but use of these compounds has several limitations on hosts like toxicity and solubility. Under the current study by deploying rigorous computational assessments, pool of microbial secondary metabolites was screened and handpicked to search a structural or functional analogue of GRL0617 and X77, with an idea to identify a compound that can serve as dual inhibitor for both PLpro and Mpro. From the manually curated database of known antiviral compounds from fungal origin, we found cytonic acids A and B to potentially serve as dual inhibitor of PLpro and Mpro.",2022-04-08,"Prajapati, Jignesh; Patel, Rohit; Rao, Priyashi; Saraf, Meenu; Rawal, Rakesh; Goswami, Dweipayan",Struct Chem,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/5ff8b02c2ce7d415c8f03f993dda16cb777422fc.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35431517/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11224-022-01932-0,248004321.0

METHODS: Malignancies were distinguished as incident or prevalent (active or inactive). Cancer management and vital status were retrieved from institutional regional databases. Comorbidities were recorded, based on Adjusted Clinical Groups (ACG). Six Resource Utilization Bands (RUBs) were also considered. Independent risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and death were identified using multivariable logistic regression, considering sex, age, comorbidities and RUBs, cancer status (active versus prevalent), primary cancer site, and treatments (chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy). RESULTS: Among 34,929 cancer patients, 1,090 (3.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (CoV2+ve). The risk of infection was associated with age (OR per 1-year increase=1.012; 95%CI=1.007-1.017), prevalent-inactive disease, hematologic malignancies (OR=1.33; 95%CI=1.03-1.72) and RUB (OR per 1-level increase=1.14; 95%CI=1.05-1.24). Among CoV2+ve cancer patients, the risk of death was doubled for males, and increased with age (OR per 1-year increase=1.07; 95%CI=1.06-1.09) and comorbidities (renal [OR=3.18; 95%CI=1.58-6.49], hematological [OR=3.08; 95%CI=1.49-6.50], respiratory [OR=2.87; 95%CI=1.61-5.14], endocrine [OR=2.09; 95%CI=1.25-3.51]). Lung and blood malignancies raised the mortality risk (OR=3.55; 95%CI=1.56-8.33, and OR=1.81; 95%CI=1.01-3.25 respectively). Incident or prevalent-active disease and recent chemotherapy and radiotherapy (OR=4.34; 95%CI=1.85-10.50) increased the risk of death. CONCLUSION: In a large cohort of cancer patients, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher for those with inactive disease than in incident or prevalent-active cases.

Whilst testing using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the current gold standard, its widespread use in LMICs is limited by high costs, turnaround times and is not readily available in most places. COVID-19 antigen tests (Ag-RDT) provide a suitable alternative due to their low cost, rapid turnaround time and easy to set up and use. This study aimed to assess the field performance of the NowCheck COVID-19 antigen kit (Ag-RDT) as a point of care test (POCT) in select healthcare facilities in western Kenya. Methods We conducted a prospective multi-facility field evaluation study of the NowCheck COVID-19 rapid antigen test (Ag-RDT) compared to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (RT-PCR). After obtaining informed consent, trained laboratory technicians collected two pairs of oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs, both antigen and RT-PCR testing, first for Ag-RDT and next for RT-PCR. We performed Ag-RDTs on-site and shared the results with both the study participants and their healthcare providers within 15-30 minutes. We carried out all RT-PCR tests in a central referral laboratory. The turnaround time for RT-PCR results was typically 24-48 hours. We captured the results of both methods using an electronic digital application. Findings Between December 2020 and March 2021, we enrolled 997 participants who met the Kenyan Ministry of Health COVID-19 case definition. The median age of study participants was 39 years (range one to 80 years), with 54% male. Ag-RDT had a sensitivity of 84.5% (76.0-90.8) and a specificity of 94.4% (95% CI: 92.7-95.8) with an accuracy of 94.2% (92.5- 95.6) when a cycle threshold value (Ct value) of [≤]35 was used. The highest sensitivity of 87.7% (77.2-94.5) was observed in samples with Ct values [≤] 30 and the highest specificity of 97.5% (96.2-98.5) at Ct value of <40. Interpretation The NowCheck COVID-19 Ag-RDT showed good performance in field evaluation in multiple healthcare facilities in a developing country. The sensitivity of the kit exceeded the minimum recommended cut-off of 80% as recommended by WHO1. The high specificity of this kit at 94.4% at Ct values [≤]33 and 97.5% at Ct values <40 matched that of real-time PCR, making it a good rule-out test for symptomatic patients with COVID-19- like symptoms.

This situation may affect snack consumption and food security. Our objective was to determine the associations among snack intake, snack accessibility and availability, household income, and food security status in US overweight college students aged 18–24 years. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was assessed through online self-reported questionnaires via Qualtrics from June 2020 to January 2021. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the frequency, percentages, and average of socio-demographic data, including household income and food security status and snack intake data. The associations among these variables were determined by logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 157 students completed the survey but only 145 completed all questions in the survey. Most students were female (84.8%), Hispanics (37.2%), with a mean age of 21.5 ± 2.0 years. The majority reported a household income of <$50,000 (60.0%) and having a high food security status (66.2%). Average snack consumption was 2.3 ± 1.1 times per day with the highest common reported frequency of snacking 2–3 times per day (61.0%). Most reported that they knew how to choose a healthy snack (85.5%) but most (73.1%) reported that unhealthy snacks (i.e., chips, crackers, cookies, candy, chocolate, etc.) were more accessible and available to them than healthy snacks (i.e., fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grain, low sugary bars/cookies/crackers, etc.). After adjusting for age and gender, those with the highest food security had significantly lower odds of choosing unhealthy snacks (OR 0.05; 95% CI 0.01, 0.36) as compared to those with the lowest food security. Also, those with lower income (<$50,000) had significantly higher odds of choosing unhealthy snacks as compared to higher income (OR 3.35; 95% CI 1.51, 7.41). However, food security and income had no association with knowledge of identifying healthy or unhealthy snacks. CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of college students, income and food security status was not related to their ability to know how to choose healthy snacks but low food security and low income were significantly related to the accessibility and availability of unhealthy snacks.

Beware of the same storm that has a different origin",,,,unk,"Some of the articles being published during the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 pandemic highlight a link between severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the so-called cytokine storm, also with increased ferritin levels. However, this scenario is more complex than initially thought due to the heterogeneity of hyperinflammation. Some patients with coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) develop a fully blown secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), whereas others, despite a consistent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, do not fulfil sHLH criteria but still show some features resembling the phenotype of the hyperferritinemic syndrome. Despite the final event (the cytokine storm) is shared by various conditions leading to sHLH, the aetiology, either infectious, autoimmune or neoplastic, accounts for the differences in the various phases of this process. Moreover, the evidence of a hyperinflammatory microenvironment provided the rationale to employ immunomodulating agents for therapeutic purposes in severe COVID-19. This viewpoint aims at discussing the pitfalls and issues to be considered with regard to the use of immunomodulating agents in COVID-19, such as timing of treatment based on the viral load and the extent of cytokine/ferritin overexpression. Furthermore, it encompasses recent findings in the paediatric field about a novel multisystem inflammatory disease resembling toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease observed in children with proven SARS-CoV2 infection. Finally, it includes arguments in favour of adding COVID-19 to the spectrum of the recently defined 'hyperferritinemic syndrome', which already includes adult-onset Still's disease, macrophage activation syndrome, septic shock and catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome.",2020,"Alunno, Alessia; Carubbi, Francesco; Rodríguez-Carrio, Javier",,,#334790,,,,,218691819.0

Inactivated vaccine should be given yearly to all of those over the age of 65, as well as younger individuals with high-risk medical conditions and individuals delivering care to such persons. Live, intranasally administered attenuated influenza vaccines are also in development, and may be useful in combination with inactivated vaccine in the elderly.

Due to the rapid increase in the counts of COVID cases, the WHO declared the COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Among the different screening techniques available for COVID-19, radiography of the chest is one of the efficient way for disease detection. While other disease detection techniques take time, radiography takes less time to identify because of the abnormalities caused by the disease in the lungs. Methods: In the rapid development era of artificial intelligence and deep-learning techniques, various models are being developed for COVID disease detection. COVID-19 can be easily detected from Chest X-ray images and the pretrained models yield high accuracy with small dataset. Results: In this paper, one of the standard deep-learning architectures, VGGNet, is modified for classifying chest X-ray images under four categories. The proposed model uses open source dataset that contains 231, 2503, 1345, and 1341 images of four classes such as COVID, bacterial, normal, and viral chest radiography images, respectively.

The plant protease inhibitors cystatin-I, Eravatmin, squash, Kunitz, Bowman-Birk, Alpha-amylase inhibitors, and potato serine protease inhibitors were screened and out of them Kunitz, alpha-amylase, and squash protease inhibitors have shown maximum binding energy. The molecular dynamics simulation was performed for docked complexes showing the lowest binding energy by NMA (normal mode analysis) to visualize the motion and stability of complexes. These plant-based protease inhibitors are a good target to fight against the new emerging strain of coronavirus because plant extracted compounds are natural and there is fewer side effect than synthetic compounds.",2022-03-14,"Kirar, Manisha; Singh, Hitesh; Sehrawat, Neelam",Inform Med Unlocked,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/43a24f29a24915816eee7ff41294c5af9394d2c6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/cbb2b130c3ce6cf0293dd7dd5a89b40a0bf38361.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8919766.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35311063/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352914822000594?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2022.100909; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352914822000594,247438365.0

Research Questions: We seek evidence on whether the lockdown has led to a reduced availability of illegal drugs and whether subjects with substance-related problems tried to cope with possible drug availability issues by increasingly obtaining drugs via the internet, replacing their preferred illegal drug with novel psychoactive substances, including new synthetic opioids (NSO), and/or by seeking drug treatment. Methods: A questionnaire was anonymously filled in by subjects with substance-related disorders, typically attending low-threshold settings, drug consumption facilities, and inpatient detoxification wards from a range of locations in the Western part of Germany. Participants had to both identify their main drug of abuse and to answer questions regarding its availability, price, quality, and routes of acquisition. Results: Data were obtained from 362 participants. The most frequent main substances of abuse were cannabis (n = 109), heroin (n = 103), and cocaine (n = 75). A minority of participants reported decreased availability (8.4%), increased price (14.4%), or decreased quality (28.3%) of their main drug. About 81% reported no change in their drug consumption due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown. A shift to the use of novel psychoactive substances including NSO were reported only by single subjects. Only 1–2% of the participants obtained their main drug via the web.

The MBL exerts its function by directly binding to microbial surfaces through its carbohydrate recognition domains, followed by direct opsonization or complement activation via MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP)-1 and -2. Thus, MBL plays a major role in the first-line innate defense against pathogens. We investigated the MBL concentrations in serum during experimental infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infections in chickens. The results showed that the acute phase MBL response to infection with IBV was, to a degree (P < 0.0068), dependent on whether the chickens were inoculated after 12 h of rest (dark) or after 12 h of activity (light). The acute phase response in chickens challenged after 12 h of activity peaked after 4.6 d with an increase of 24%, whereas the acute phase response in chickens challenged after 12 h of rest peaked after 3.1 d with an increase of 51%. The specific antibody titer against IBV was also tested, and a difference (P < 0.0091) between the two experimental groups was found with peak titer values of 6,816 and 4,349. However, the highest value was found in chickens inoculated after 12 h of activity. Thus, an inverse relation exists between the MBL response and the IBV specific antibody response. The ability of MBL to activate the complement cascade was tested in a heterologous system by deposition of human C4 on the chicken MBL/MASP complex. The complement activation was directly associated with the concentration of MBL in serum, indicating neutralization of the virus before the humoral antibody response took over.",2003-02-01,"Juul-Madsen, HR; Munch, M; Handberg, KJ; Sorensen, P; Johnson, AA; Norup, LR; Jorgensen, PH",Poultry Science,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ff38214f7139e1f7cf972075cec62d758d1dafb3.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3497e6136b784520585371711434488d28aa4c9f.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12619800/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119449420; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0032579119449420,3634600.0

The authors examined a large selection of published health sector disaster response models to generate a set of best practice guidelines for such models. METHODS . The authors reviewed a spectrum of published disaster response models addressing public health or health care delivery, focusing in particular on the type of disaster and response decisions considered, decision makers targeted, choice of outcomes evaluated, modeling methodology, and reporting format. They developed initial recommendations for best practices for creating and reporting such models and refined these guidelines after soliciting feedback from response modeling experts and from members of the Society for Medical Decision Making. RESULTS . The authors propose 6 recommendations for model construction and reporting, inspired by the most exemplary models: health sector disaster response models should address real-world problems, be designed for maximum usability by response planners, strike the appropriate balance between simplicity and complexity, include appropriate outcomes that extend beyond those considered in traditional cost-effectiveness analyses, and be designed to evaluate the many uncertainties inherent in disaster response. Finally, good model reporting is particularly critical for disaster response models. CONCLUSIONS . Quantitative models are critical tools for planning effective health sector responses to disasters. The proposed recommendations can increase the applicability and interpretability of future models, thereby improving strategic, tactical, and operational aspects of preparedness planning and response.",2009,"Brandeau, Margaret L; McCoy, Jessica H; Hupert, Nathaniel; Holty, Jon-Erik; Bravata, Dena M",Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x09340346; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19605887/,31856864.0

While the hallmarks of SARS-CoV-2 and severe COVID-19 within routine laboratory parameters are emerging, the impact of sex and age on these profiles is still unknown. Methods We performed multidimensional analysis of millions of records of laboratory parameters and diagnostic tests for 178,887 individuals from Brazil, of which 33,266 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. These included complete blood cell count, electrolytes, metabolites, arterial blood gases, enzymes, hormones, cancer biomarkers, and others. Findings COVID-19 induced similar alterations in laboratory parameters in males and females. CRP and ferritin were increased especially in older men with COVID-19, whereas abnormal liver function tests were common across several age groups, except for young women. Low peripheral blood basophils and eosinophils were more common in the elderly with COVID-19. Both male and female COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units displayed alterations in the coagulation system, and higher values of neutrophils, CRP and lactate dehydrogenase.

The aim of this study was to update data on the prevalence of seropositive individuals in Canton Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H) from September 2020 to May 2021. METHODS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were quantified using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. RESULTS: Compared to the period April–July 2020, when anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 3.77% of samples, one year later (May 2021) the estimated percentage within the same population of the urban Canton Sarajevo was 29.9% (5,406/18,066). Of all anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig-positive individuals, 53.27% were men, and 69.00% were of 50 years of age or younger. Also, the current update found the individuals 50 years of age or younger to be more frequently anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig positive compared to older individuals. On the other hand, higher median anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig levels were found in individuals > 50 years old than in younger individuals, as well as in men compared to women. Seropositivity gradually increased from September 2020 to May 2021, with the lowest frequency of positive cases (3.5%) observed in September 2020, and the highest frequency (77.7%) in January 2021.

oiz9ylqm,,WHO,IL-6 modulation for COVID-19: the right patients at the right time?,,,,unk,"The ongoing pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has disrupted the global economy and strained healthcare systems to their limits. After the virus first emerged in late 2019, the first intervention that demonstrated significant reductions in mortality for severe COVID-19 in large-scale trials was corticosteroids. Additional options that may reduce the burden on the healthcare system by reducing the number of patients requiring intensive care unit support are desperately needed, yet no therapy has conclusively established benefit in randomized studies for the management of moderate or mild cases of disease. Severe COVID-19 disease is characterized by a respiratory distress syndrome accompanied by elevated levels of several systemic cytokines, in a profile that shares several features with known inflammatory pathologies such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and cytokine release syndrome secondary to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. Based on these observations, modulation of inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin (IL)-6, was proposed as a strategy to mitigate severe disease. Despite encouraging recoveries with anti-IL-6 agents, especially tocilizumab from single-arm studies, early randomized trials returned mixed results in terms of clinical benefit with these interventions. Later, larger trials such as RECOVERY and REMAP-CAP, however, are establishing anti-IL-6 in combination with steroids as a potential option for hypoxic patients with evidence of hyperinflammation. We propose that a positive feedback loop primarily mediated by macrophages and monocytes initiates the inflammatory cascade in severe COVID-19, and thus optimal benefit with anti-IL-6 therapies may require intervention during a finite window of opportunity at the outset of hyperinflammation but before fulminant disease causes irreversible tissue damage-as defined clinically by C reactive protein levels higher than 75 mg/L.",2021,"Ascierto, Paolo Antonio; Fu, Binqing; Wei, Haiming",J. immunotherap. cancer,,#covidwho-1175186,,,,,233201553.0
