# üìä CORD-19 Data Explorer

This project is a **Streamlit web application** for exploring the **CORD-19 research dataset** (COVID-19 research papers metadata).  
It demonstrates basic **data analysis, visualization, and web app development** using Python.

## üìÅ Dataset Information

The original dataset (`metadata.csv`) is very large and cannot be uploaded directly to GitHub.  
Instead, I created a **sample of 2000 rows** for this project to make it manageable.

- **Full dataset**: [CORD-19 on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge)  
- **Sample dataset used here**: `metadata_sample.csv` (2000 random rows)  

The sample ensures the app runs smoothly on **Streamlit Cloud** while still providing meaningful insights.
